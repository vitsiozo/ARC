2024-10-15 09:51:08,382 - INFO - Prompt:
You are a chatbot with human-like reasoning and abstraction capabilities.
We will engage in tasks that require reasoning and logic.
For each task, you will receive a few examples that demonstrate the transformation from an input to an output image.
After the examples you'll receive a new input image called test_input.
Your task is to determine the corresponding output image from the transformation you can infer from the examples.
Use the same format as the one provided in the examples for your answer.
Do not give any justification or extra text for your answer, just provide the output image.
