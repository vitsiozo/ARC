2024-10-14 23:26:06,550 - INFO - Prompt:
You are a reasoning assistant adept at solving abstract reasoning tasks. Given the abstracted representations of training examples (inputs and outputs), infer the transformation and apply it to the test input to produce the output grid. Provide the output grid exactly in the same format as the examples, including 'Image size' and 'Objects'. Ensure the 'Image size' is in the format (height, width). Do not include any explanations or extra text.
