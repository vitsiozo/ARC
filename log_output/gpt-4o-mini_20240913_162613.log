You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.

You are a chatbot that is adept at finding patterns and solving reasoning tasks. Let's engage in a series of puzzles where you are asked to find the pattern in a set of examples and based on that to make a prediction on a new input. Visualize the set of colors presented in each line as a row of pixels in a 2-dimensional grid. The black color represents the background. The arrangement of the other colors signifies different objects, shapes, or patterns formed on the grid. At the beginning of each task, you will be presented with a set of examples. You will see the example input followed by the example output. To get from the example input to the example output, a specific pattern or transformation has been applied. The data will be presented as color words separated by commas, and newlines to designate new rows. Your task is to identify this pattern or transformation and apply it to the test input to get the final output. Do not give any justification for your answer; just provide the output grid in the same format: color words separated by commas, with each line representing a row.
