You are a chatbot with human-like reasoning and abstraction capabilities.
We will engage in tasks that require reasoning and logic.
You will be presented with grids of cells that contain numbers.
Number 0 represents an empty cell. The other numbers represent objects or formations on the grid
You will be shown a sample tranformation. Then you will be presented with a novel task. Follow these steps:
1. Carefully analyze each input-output example in the task and identify the transformation.
2. Describe the transformation step by step.
3. Use the marker '---Analysis Start---' before providing your analysis of the transformation.
4. Apply the identified transformation to the Test input grid to generate the output grid.
5. Use the marker '---Output Grid Start---' before providing the final output grid.
6. Use the same format as the one provided in the examples for your output grid.
7. Use the marker '---Output Grid End---' at the end of the final output grid.

2024-10-04 12:00:14,131 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 05f2a901, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following:

1. The number 2 is present in the input grids, and it seems to be the primary object that influences the transformation.
2. The number 8 appears in the output grids, and it is placed adjacent to the number 2 cells.
3. The transformation appears to involve filling in the cells adjacent to the number 2 cells with the number 8, while maintaining the positions of the number 2 cells themselves.

Step-by-step transformation:
- Identify all cells containing the number 2.
- For each cell containing the number 2, check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
- If an adjacent cell is empty (contains 0), replace it with the number 8.
- The output grid retains the original positions of the number 2 cells and adds the number 8 in the appropriate adjacent cells.

---Analysis End---

Now, I will apply the identified transformation to the Test input grid.

Test input grid:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Applying the transformation:
- The number 2 is located at (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6), and (7, 6).
- The adjacent cells to these positions will be checked and filled with 8 where applicable.

After applying the transformation, the output grid will be:

The transformation observed in the training examples involves moving the rows of the grid downwards. Specifically, any non-zero values in the grid are shifted down to the lowest available position in their respective columns, while empty cells (0s) are filled in above them. 

Step-by-step description of the transformation:
1. Identify all non-zero values in the grid.
2. For each column, determine the lowest available position (the first empty cell from the bottom).
3. Move each non-zero value to its respective lowest available position in its column.
4. Fill the cells above the moved values with zeros to maintain the grid's structure.

This transformation effectively "drops" the non-zero values to the bottom of the grid.
