2024-10-04 11:23:44,995 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 05f2a901, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. The grid appears to be divided into two main sections: the upper part and the lower part.
2. The transformation involves moving certain formations (specifically the numbers 2 and 8) downwards in the grid.
3. The numbers 2 and 8 are shifted down to fill the empty spaces (0s) below them, while maintaining their relative positions to each other.
4. The empty cells (0s) in the upper part of the grid are filled with 0s, while the lower part retains the formations of 2s and 8s.
5. The overall structure of the grid remains the same, but the positions of the numbers are adjusted to create a more compact formation towards the bottom of the grid.

In summary, the transformation involves shifting the numbers downwards while keeping the empty cells above them.

2024-10-04 11:23:50,490 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 25ff71a9, Test Input Index 0:
To identify the transformation, we can observe the provided examples:

1. In Example 1, the first row of 1s is moved to the second row, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.
2. In Example 2, the row of 1s is moved from the second row to the last row.
3. In Example 3, the row of 1s is moved down one row, pushing the previous row down to the empty row.
4. In Example 4, the row of 2s is moved down to the last two rows, with the first row becoming empty.

From these examples, we can conclude that the transformation involves moving the highest non-zero row down to the first available empty row below it, while pushing any existing rows down.

Now, applying this logic to the Test input grid:
Input:
[
[2, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0]
]

The highest non-zero row is the first row (containing 2s). We will move this row down to the first available empty row, which is the last row. The second row will then move down to the third row, and the first row will become empty.

The transformation will result in:
1. Move the first row [2, 0, 0] down to the last row.
2. Move the second row [2, 0, 0] down to the second row.
3. The first row will become [0, 0, 0].

Thus, the output grid will be:
[
[0, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 0]

To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following pattern:

1. The transformation appears to involve moving the non-zero elements (objects or formations) downwards in the grid.
2. Specifically, the non-zero elements are shifted down to the lowest available empty cells (represented by 0) in their respective columns.
3. If there are multiple non-zero elements in a column, they will stack at the bottom of that column, filling the empty cells from the bottom up.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the Test input grid.

Test Input:
[
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0]
]

In this grid:
- The only non-zero element is '1' located at (1, 1).
- There are two empty cells below it (at (2, 1) and (0, 1)).
- According to the transformation, '1' will move down to the lowest available empty cell, which is (2, 1).

After applying the transformation, the output grid will be:
[
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0]
