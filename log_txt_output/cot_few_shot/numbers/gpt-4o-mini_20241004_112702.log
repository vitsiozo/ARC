2024-10-04 11:27:16,915 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 05f2a901, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify the Movement**: The numbers in the grid seem to be shifting downwards. Specifically, the numbers '2' and '8' are moving down to fill the empty spaces (represented by '0') below them.

2. **Preserve the Order**: The order of the numbers is preserved as they move down. For example, if there are two '2's in a row, they remain in that order after the transformation.

3. **Fill from the Bottom**: The transformation appears to fill the grid from the bottom up. Any empty cells (0s) below the numbers are filled first, and the numbers that are already present move down to the lowest available position.

4. **No Change to Empty Cells**: The empty cells (0s) remain unchanged unless they are filled by moving numbers.

5. **Boundary Conditions**: The transformation respects the boundaries of the grid, meaning that numbers do not wrap around or move outside the grid limits.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input grid:

To identify the transformation, we can observe the provided examples:

1. In Example 1, the first row of 1s is moved to the second row, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.
2. In Example 2, the row of 1s is moved from the second row to the last row.
3. In Example 3, the row of 1s is moved down one row, while the first row becomes empty.
4. In Example 4, the row of 2s is moved down to the last two rows, with the first row becoming empty.

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation involves moving the highest non-zero row downwards in the grid, while filling the rows above it with zeros.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test input grid:
Input:
[
[2, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0]
]

The highest non-zero row is the first row. We will move this row down to the last row, and the rows above it will be filled with zeros.

Step-by-step transformation:
1. Identify the highest non-zero row (the first row with 2s).
2. Move this row down to the last row.
3. Fill the rows above with zeros.

The resulting output grid will be:

To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following pattern:

1. The transformation appears to involve moving the non-zero elements (objects or formations) downwards in the grid.
2. Specifically, the non-zero elements in each column are shifted down to the lowest available empty cells (represented by 0) in that column.
3. If there are multiple non-zero elements in a column, they will stack at the bottom of the column, while the empty cells above them will be filled with zeros.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the Test input grid.

Test Input:
[
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0]
]

In this grid:
- The only non-zero element is '1' located at (1, 1).
- There are two empty cells below it (at (2, 1) and (0, 1)).

Following the transformation:
- The '1' will move down to (2, 1).
- The cell (1, 1) will become empty (0).

The resulting output grid will be:
[
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0]

2024-10-04 11:27:40,274 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 3906de3d, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. The transformation primarily involves replacing certain numbers (specifically '0's) with '2's based on their proximity to other numbers.
2. The '2's are introduced in the grid where there are '1's directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to the '0's.
3. The transformation appears to propagate '2's into the grid from the existing '2's, filling in '0's that are adjacent to '1's.
4. The '1's remain unchanged unless they are adjacent to a '0' that is being transformed into a '2'.

By following these observations, we can deduce that the transformation is about filling in '0's with '2's based on the presence of '1's around them.

To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. The number '8' represents a certain object or formation on the grid. The transformation seems to involve replacing some of the '8's with '1's based on their positions relative to other '8's.
2. The '1's appear to be placed in positions that are adjacent (either vertically or horizontally) to the '8's, specifically in the first available empty cell (0) encountered when scanning from left to right and top to bottom.
3. The placement of '1's does not disrupt the existing '8's; instead, they are added to the grid in a way that maintains the overall structure of the '8's.

In the provided examples, we can see that:
- The first '1' is placed in the first available cell adjacent to an '8' when scanning the grid.
- The process continues until all possible placements of '1's adjacent to '8's are filled.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test input grid:
1. We will scan the grid from the top-left to the bottom-right.
2. For each '8' found, we will check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) for the first available '0' to replace with '1'.

Test Input:
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

Following the steps outlined, we will identify the positions for '1's based on the '8's present in the grid.

To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The transformation appears to involve a reordering of the numbers in each row of the grid.
2. The numbers are sorted in a specific way, where the smallest numbers are moved to the left and the largest numbers are moved to the right within each row.
3. The number '0' (if present) is treated as an empty cell and does not affect the sorting of other numbers.
4. The sorting seems to be done in a way that maintains the relative order of the same numbers.

Now, let's break down the transformation step by step:
- For each row in the input grid, we extract the numbers, ignoring any '0's.
- We then sort these numbers in ascending order.
- Finally, we place the sorted numbers back into the row, filling in any empty cells (0s) as needed.

Applying this reasoning to the test input grid:
Input:
[
[6, 4, 4],
[6, 6, 4],
[4, 6, 7]
]

1. For the first row [6, 4, 4], sorting gives us [4, 4, 6].
2. For the second row [6, 6, 4], sorting gives us [4, 6, 6].
3. For the third row [4, 6, 7], sorting gives us [4, 6, 7].

Now we can compile the output grid based on the sorted rows.

To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The number '5' in the input grid remains unchanged in the output grid.
2. The number '1' appears in the output grid, which seems to be filling the spaces around the number '5'.
3. The '1's form a continuous block around the '5's, creating a sort of border or outline.
4. The '1's appear to fill the cells directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the '5's, and also extend to form a larger connected area around them.

In summary, the transformation involves:
- Keeping the '5's in their original positions.
- Filling adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) with '1's, and potentially extending this filling to create a larger connected area of '1's around the '5's.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the Test input grid.

2024-10-04 11:28:24,616 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 4347f46a, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify the Patterns**: The numbers in the grid represent different objects or formations. The number 0 represents empty cells, while other numbers represent specific formations.

2. **Shifting Elements**: The transformation appears to involve shifting certain elements to the left within their respective rows while maintaining their vertical alignment. Specifically:
   - The number 8 in the second and third rows is shifted to the left, with some cells becoming empty (0).
   - The number 6 in the eleventh row is also shifted to the left, with some cells becoming empty (0).
   - The number 4 in the sixth to twelfth rows is shifted to the left, with some cells becoming empty (0).
   - The number 1 in the sixth to twelfth rows is also shifted to the left, with some cells becoming empty (0).

3. **Maintaining Structure**: The overall structure of the grid is maintained, with the empty cells filling in where the numbers have been shifted from.

4. **Final Adjustments**: After shifting, the remaining numbers are adjusted to ensure that they are contiguous and that there are no gaps between them.

The transformation can be summarized as a leftward shift of non-zero numbers in each row, filling in gaps with zeros.

2024-10-04 11:28:37,411 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 50cb2852, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The number '1' in the input grid is transformed into '8' in the output grid. This transformation occurs in specific locations where '1' is surrounded by '0's or other '1's, indicating that '1's are part of a larger formation.

2. The number '2' remains '2' in most cases, but in certain rows, it is transformed into '8' when it is part of a larger formation, similar to the '1's.

3. The number '3' remains '3' in the output grid, indicating that it is not affected by the transformation.

4. The transformation seems to focus on creating a more defined structure by changing certain numbers to '8' to indicate a more significant formation or object.

5. The transformation is applied selectively based on the surrounding numbers, suggesting a rule-based approach to identify which numbers to change.

Now, applying this reasoning to the test input grid, we will look for '1's and '2's that can be transformed into '8's based on their positions and surroundings.

To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The numbers in the grid represent certain objects or formations, while the number 0 represents empty cells.
2. The transformation appears to involve replacing the last row of the grid with a specific pattern that includes the number 4 and possibly other numbers.
3. In the output grids, the last row always contains the number 4 in specific positions, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged from the input.

From the examples:
- In Example 1, the last row of the output grid has two 4s placed at the 3rd and 7th columns.
- In Example 2, the last row has a 4 in the 3rd column.
- In Example 3, the last row has two 4s placed at the 5th and 7th columns.

The pattern seems to be that the last row of the output grid is modified to include the number 4 in specific positions, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.

Now, applying this understanding to the Test input grid:
- The last row of the Test input grid will be modified to include the number 4 in specific positions, while the rest of the grid will remain unchanged.

To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify Non-Zero Elements**: In both examples, we first identify all the non-zero elements in the input grid. These elements will be moved to the bottom-right of the output grid.

2. **Count Non-Zero Elements**: We count how many non-zero elements there are in the input grid. This count will determine how many rows and columns will be filled in the output grid.

3. **Fill the Output Grid**: The output grid is filled starting from the bottom-right corner, moving left and then up, placing the non-zero elements in the order they were found in the input grid.

4. **Fill Remaining Cells with Zeros**: Any remaining cells in the output grid that are not filled with non-zero elements will be filled with zeros.

Now, applying this reasoning to the test input grid:
Input:
[
[6, 3, 5],
[6, 8, 0],
[4, 0, 0]
]

- Non-zero elements identified: 6, 3, 5, 6, 8, 4 (total of 6 non-zero elements).
- The output grid will be a 3x3 grid, and we will fill it from the bottom-right corner.

The filled output grid will look like this:
- Start filling from the bottom-right:

2024-10-04 11:28:55,758 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 67385a82, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The number '3' in the input grid is transformed into '8' in the output grid. This indicates that the transformation is likely summing the values of adjacent '3's in a specific manner.
2. The transformation seems to only affect the '3's that are adjacent to each other vertically or horizontally. When two '3's are adjacent, they are replaced by '8's in the output grid.
3. If a '3' is isolated (not adjacent to another '3'), it remains unchanged in the output grid.
4. The transformation does not affect the '0's, which remain '0's in the output grid.

Now, let's apply this reasoning to the test input grid.

Test Input:
[
[3, 0, 3, 0, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0]
]

Step-by-step transformation:
- In the first row, the '3's at (0,0) and (0,2) are isolated, so they remain '3'. The '3' at (0,4) is also isolated.
- In the second row, the '3's at (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2) are adjacent, so they transform into '8's. The '0's remain '0's.
- In the third row, the '3' at (2,4) is isolated, so it remains '3'.
- In the fourth row, the '3's at (3,1) and (3,2) are adjacent, so they transform into '8's. The '0's remain '0's.
- In the fifth row, the '3's at (4,1) and (4,2) are adjacent, so they transform into '8's. The '0's remain '0's.

Now, we can compile the output grid based on these transformations.

To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify the Minimum Value in Each Column**: For each column in the grid, we need to find the minimum value present. This will be the value that will replace the values in that column.

2. **Replace Values in Each Column**: Once we have identified the minimum value for each column, we will replace all the values in that column with the identified minimum value.

3. **Preserve the Structure**: The overall structure of the grid remains the same; only the values are modified based on the minimum values found in each column.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the Test input grid.

2024-10-04 11:29:15,206 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 6855a6e4, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify the Structure**: The output grid maintains the same overall structure as the input grid, but certain elements have been shifted or rearranged.

2. **Zero Rows**: The first few rows of the output grid are completely filled with zeros, indicating that any non-zero elements in the input grid that were in these rows have been removed.

3. **Shifting Elements**: The non-zero elements (specifically the numbers 2 and 5) appear to be shifted downwards in the grid. The 2s and 5s that were present in the input grid have been moved to lower rows in the output grid.

4. **Preservation of Non-Zero Elements**: The arrangement of the non-zero elements (2s and 5s) is preserved in terms of their relative positions, but they are moved downwards to fill the empty spaces created by the zeros.

5. **Final Arrangement**: The output grid has a clear pattern where the non-zero elements are concentrated towards the middle and lower parts of the grid, while the upper part is cleared out.

In summary, the transformation involves clearing out the upper rows of the grid and shifting the non-zero elements downwards while maintaining their relative positions.

2024-10-04 11:29:22,483 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 694f12f3, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The grid is divided into two main sections: the upper part and the lower part.
2. In the upper part (rows 0 to 5), the number 4 is consistently present, forming a solid block.
3. In the lower part (rows 6 to 9), the number 4 also forms a solid block, but there are some changes in the middle rows.
4. The transformation seems to involve replacing some of the 4s with 2s and 1s in specific positions, particularly in the middle rows of the upper and lower sections.

Specifically:
- In the first example, the transformation replaces certain 4s in the middle rows with 1s and 2s, creating a pattern that appears to be a kind of "cut-out" or "carving" effect.
- The 1s appear in the third and fourth rows of the upper section, while the 2s appear in the eighth and ninth rows of the lower section.

In summary, the transformation involves:
- Keeping the outer structure of 4s intact.
- Introducing 1s and 2s in specific positions to create a new pattern.

1. **Identify Groups of 1s**: The transformation seems to focus on groups of adjacent 1s. These groups are identified and will be transformed into the number 2 in the output grid.

2. **Transforming Groups**: Each group of adjacent 1s (horizontally or vertically) is replaced with the number 2. The number of 2s corresponds to the number of 1s in that group.

3. **Handling Zeros**: The zeros in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

4. **Maintaining Structure**: The overall structure of the grid is maintained, meaning that the positions of the zeros and the arrangement of the groups of 1s are preserved, but the 1s are replaced with 2s.

5. **Edge Cases**: If there are isolated 1s (not part of a group), they will also be transformed into 2s.

Now, applying this reasoning to the test input grid:

2024-10-04 11:29:47,984 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 6d75e8bb, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The number '8' represents a certain object or formation on the grid, while '0' represents an empty cell.
2. The transformation appears to replace certain '8's with '2's based on their surrounding context.
3. Specifically, '8's that are surrounded by other '8's or are part of a continuous formation of '8's tend to remain '8's, while isolated '8's or those that are adjacent to '0's are replaced with '2's.
4. The transformation seems to create a more structured pattern, where '2's are introduced to indicate a change in the formation of '8's.

In the provided examples, the transformation can be summarized as follows:
- Identify '8's that are isolated or part of a smaller cluster and replace them with '2's.
- Maintain larger clusters of '8's intact.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test input grid:
1. Identify all '8's in the grid.
2. Determine which '8's are isolated or part of smaller clusters.
3. Replace those identified '8's with '2's while keeping larger clusters of '8's unchanged.

2024-10-04 11:30:13,982 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 6e82a1ae, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The number '5' in the input grid is transformed into '2' or '3' in the output grid, depending on its position and surrounding numbers.
2. The transformation seems to involve grouping the '5's into clusters, where:
   - A cluster of '5's that is isolated or surrounded by '0's becomes '2'.
   - A cluster of '5's that is part of a larger formation or connected to other '5's becomes '3'.
3. The output grid maintains the overall structure of the input grid, with '0's remaining '0's and the '5's being replaced by '2's and '3's based on their connectivity.

For example:
- In Example 1, the '5's are grouped and transformed into '1's and '2's based on their positions.
- In Example 2, the '5's are transformed similarly, with some becoming '2's and others '3's based on their arrangement.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test input grid:
- We will identify clusters of '5's and determine their transformations based on their connectivity.

2024-10-04 11:30:19,631 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 74dd1130, Test Input Index 0:
To identify the transformation applied to the input grids, we can observe the following patterns from the provided examples:

1. The transformation appears to involve rearranging the numbers in each row based on their values, while maintaining the overall structure of the grid.
2. Specifically, the largest number in each row is moved to the leftmost position, and the remaining numbers are shifted accordingly.
3. If there are multiple occurrences of the same number, they are grouped together, and the order of the numbers is preserved as much as possible.
4. The empty cells (0) are not present in the examples, but if they were, they would likely remain in their positions.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the Test input grid.

Test Input:
[
[9, 3, 4],
[9, 4, 4],
[9, 3, 4]
]

Step-by-step transformation:
- For the first row [9, 3, 4], the largest number is 9, so it stays in the first position. The remaining numbers (3 and 4) are sorted to [4, 3]. The transformed row becomes [9, 4, 3].
- For the second row [9, 4, 4], the largest number is again 9, which stays in the first position. The remaining numbers (4 and 4) are already sorted. The transformed row remains [9, 4, 4].
- For the third row [9, 3, 4], similar to the first row, the transformed row becomes [9, 4, 3].

Thus, the output grid after applying the transformation will be:
[
[9, 4, 3],
[9, 4, 4],
[9, 4, 3]

To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the provided examples, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify the Maximum Value**: The transformation appears to focus on the maximum value present in the grid. In the first example, the maximum value is 7, and in the second example, it is 6. In the third example, it is 5.

2. **Shift Values Upward**: The transformation seems to shift the rows of the grid upward, effectively moving the rows containing the maximum value closer to the top of the grid. Rows that do not contain the maximum value are replaced with zeros.

3. **Retain Structure**: The structure of the maximum value formations is retained, meaning that the arrangement of the maximum values is preserved in the output grid.

4. **Fill Empty Rows**: Any rows that do not contain the maximum value are filled with zeros.

5. **Final Arrangement**: The final output grid has the maximum value formations at the top, with all other rows below them filled with zeros.

Now, applying this analysis to the Test input grid:
- The maximum value is 8.
- We will shift the rows containing 8 upwards and fill the remaining rows with zeros.

2024-10-04 11:30:37,601 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 810b9b61, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify the number to be replaced**: In the provided examples, the number '1' is consistently replaced with '3' in the output grid.

2. **Preserve the structure**: The zeros (0) remain unchanged, and the positions of the numbers that are not '1' (like '0' and '1') are preserved in their respective locations.

3. **Replace '1' with '3'**: Every occurrence of '1' in the input grid is replaced with '3' in the output grid.

4. **No other transformations**: Other numbers (like '0') remain unchanged, and the overall structure of the grid is maintained.

Now, applying this transformation to the Test input grid:
- Every '1' will be replaced with '3'.
- All '0's will remain as '0'.

2024-10-04 11:30:43,990 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 88a10436, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. The numbers in the grid represent different objects or formations, and the goal is to rearrange them based on certain rules.
2. The transformation appears to involve moving certain formations downwards in the grid while maintaining their relative positions.
3. Specifically, the numbers that are not zero (representing objects) are shifted downwards to fill empty spaces (represented by zeros) below them.
4. The last row of the grid is filled with the lowest numbers from the previous rows, while the upper rows are adjusted accordingly to maintain the structure of the formations.

For example, in the provided examples:
- In Example 1, the number '5' from row 5 is moved down to row 4, and the numbers '2' and '1' from row 2 and row 3 are moved down to fill the spaces.
- In Example 2, the number '6' is moved down to the first available position in row 5, and the numbers '1' and '2' are also moved down to fill the empty spaces.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test input grid:
- The numbers '2', '1', and '3' will be moved down to fill the empty spaces below them, while maintaining their relative positions.

2024-10-04 11:30:58,960 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 913fb3ed, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Identifying Key Numbers**: The numbers 3, 2, and 8 in the input grids seem to play a significant role in determining the structure of the output grids. Specifically:
   - The number 3 appears to be the center of a formation that expands outward.
   - The number 2 also contributes to a formation, but it seems to be less central than 3.
   - The number 8 appears to be a fixed point around which other numbers are arranged.

2. **Formation Patterns**:
   - The number 3 generates a vertical and horizontal line of 6s around it, creating a cross-like formation.
   - The number 2 generates a smaller formation of 1s around it, which is less prominent than the formation created by 3.
   - The number 8 remains in its position but is surrounded by 4s, creating a square-like formation.

3. **Empty Cells**: The empty cells (0s) remain unchanged unless they are part of the formation created by the numbers mentioned above.

4. **Grid Size**: The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.

5. **General Rule**: 
   - For every occurrence of 3, create a cross of 6s.
   - For every occurrence of 2, create a smaller formation of 1s.
   - For every occurrence of 8, create a square of 4s around it.

Now, applying this analysis to the test input grid:
- The grid contains a 3, which will create a cross of 6s.
- It also contains a 2, which will create a smaller formation of 1s.
- There is an 8 that will create a square of 4s around it.

Following these rules, we will construct the output grid.

To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 8 are present in the input grids, while the output grids contain the number 5 in certain positions.
2. The number 5 appears in the output grid wherever there is a number 8 in the input grid. This suggests that the presence of 8 triggers a transformation to 5 in the corresponding output grid.
3. The other numbers (1, 2, 3) remain unchanged in their positions unless they are adjacent to an 8, which leads to the transformation of their neighboring cells to 5.
4. The transformation seems to be focused on replacing the 8s and their adjacent cells with 5s while keeping the other numbers intact.

In summary, the transformation can be described as:
- Replace any 8 in the input grid with 5 in the output grid.
- Replace any adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) of an 8 with 5 in the output grid.
- All other numbers remain unchanged.

Now, applying this transformation to the Test input grid:
Input:
[
[1, 3, 2],
[3, 3, 2],
[1, 3, 2]
]

There are no 8s in the input grid, so no transformations will occur. The output grid will be the same as the input grid.

To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify Non-Zero Elements**: The transformation seems to focus on moving non-zero elements to the leftmost available positions in their respective rows while maintaining their order.

2. **Shift Non-Zero Elements**: For each row, we shift all non-zero elements to the left, filling in the empty cells (0s) that were previously occupied by non-zero elements.

3. **Preserve Order**: The order of the non-zero elements is preserved as they are shifted left.

4. **Fill Remaining Cells**: After shifting, any remaining cells in the row that are still empty (0s) remain as 0.

5. **Apply to Each Row Independently**: This transformation is applied independently to each row of the grid.

Now, applying this transformation to the test input grid:

2024-10-04 11:31:14,209 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID a5313dff, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. The number '2' represents a solid object or formation, while '1' represents a modified or transformed state of '2'.
2. The transformation appears to replace certain '2's with '1's based on their surrounding context. Specifically, '2's that are surrounded by other '2's in a vertical or horizontal manner are transformed into '1's.
3. The transformation does not affect the outermost '2's that are adjacent to '0's, as they remain unchanged.
4. The transformation seems to create a pattern where '1's form a sort of inner structure within the '2's, while maintaining the overall shape of the formation.

Now, applying this reasoning to the test input grid, we will identify which '2's should be transformed into '1's based on their surrounding '2's.

To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The transformation appears to involve counting the number of adjacent cells that contain the number 1 for each cell in the grid. The adjacent cells are those that are directly above, below, left, right, and diagonally adjacent to the cell in question.

2. For each cell that contains a 1 in the input grid, we will increment the corresponding cell in the output grid by 1 for each adjacent cell that also contains a 1.

3. Cells that contain 0 in the input grid remain 0 in the output grid.

4. The output grid reflects the count of adjacent 1s for each cell, while maintaining the structure of the original grid.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the provided test input grid.

2024-10-04 11:31:29,063 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID a79310a0, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify the Number 8**: The number 8 in the input grid represents a specific object or formation that needs to be transformed.
2. **Count the Number of 8s**: We need to count how many 8s are present in each row of the input grid.
3. **Transform 8s to 2s**: For each row that contains 8s, we replace them with 2s in the output grid. The number of 2s corresponds to the number of 8s in that row.
4. **Shift Down**: The 2s are placed in the row below the row where the 8s were found. If there are multiple rows with 8s, the 2s from the upper rows will stack downwards.
5. **Fill Remaining Cells with 0s**: Any cells that do not contain 2s will remain as 0s in the output grid.

Now, applying this analysis to the test input grid:
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```
- In the first row, there is 1 occurrence of 8, so we will place 1 occurrence of 2 in the row below.
- In the second row, there are 2 occurrences of 8, so we will place 2 occurrences of 2 in the row below.
- In the third row, there is 1 occurrence of 8, so we will place 1 occurrence of 2 in the row below.

The placement of 2s will be as follows:
- The first row will have no 2s.
- The second row will have no 2s.
- The third row will have 1 occurrence of 2 in the row below the second row.
- The fourth row will have 2 occurrences of 2 in the row below the second row.
- The fifth row will have 1 occurrence of 2 in the row below the second row.

Thus, the output grid will be:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the provided examples, we can observe the following steps:

1. Identify the highest number in the grid that is not zero. This number will be replaced by the next highest number in the output grid.
2. The number that replaces the highest number is the number that appears in the last row of the input grid.
3. All occurrences of the highest number in the input grid are replaced with the number from the last row of the input grid.
4. The rest of the grid remains unchanged, except for the replaced numbers.

For Example 1:
- The highest number is 2, and the last row contains 4.
- All 2s in the grid are replaced with 4s.

For Example 2:
- The highest number is 3, and the last row contains 6.
- All 3s in the grid are replaced with 6s.

Now, applying this logic to the Test input grid:
- The highest number is 8, and the last row contains 2.
- All occurrences of 8 in the grid will be replaced with 2.

To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify the Movement of Numbers**: The numbers in the grid seem to be moving towards the left and upwards, filling in the empty cells (0s) as they do so. 

2. **Shift Non-Zero Values**: For each row, we need to shift all non-zero values to the left, maintaining their order. Any empty cells (0s) that are left behind should remain as 0s.

3. **Preserve the Structure**: The overall structure of the grid remains the same, but the positions of the non-zero values change based on the leftward shift.

4. **Handle Rows Independently**: Each row is treated independently, meaning the transformation does not affect other rows.

5. **Final Output**: After applying the leftward shift to all rows, we construct the output grid.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the provided test input grid.

2024-10-04 11:31:49,338 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID aedd82e4, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. The output grid retains the same structure as the input grid, meaning the dimensions and positions of the numbers remain unchanged.
2. The transformation appears to involve replacing the last occurrence of the number '2' in each column with the number '1'. If there are no '2's in a column, no changes are made to that column.
3. The replacement of '2' with '1' occurs from the bottom of the grid upwards, ensuring that only the last '2' in each column is affected.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the provided test input grid.

Test Input:
[
[2, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0],
[2, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 2]
]

Step-by-step application of the transformation:
- For column 0: The last '2' is at (3, 0), so we replace it with '1'.
- For column 1: The last '2' is at (1, 1), so we replace it with '1'.
- For column 2: The last '2' is at (2, 2), so we replace it with '1'.
- For column 3: The last '2' is at (0, 3), so we replace it with '1'.

After applying these changes, we get the following output grid.

To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The number '6' in the input grid is consistently transformed into '2' in the output grid.
2. The number '7' remains unchanged in the output grid.
3. The transformation appears to replace all occurrences of '6' with '2', while '7' retains its original value.

This transformation can be summarized as:
- Replace every '6' with '2'.
- Keep every '7' as '7'.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the Test input grid.

Test Input:
[
[6, 7, 7, 6],
[6, 7, 6, 7],
[7, 7, 7, 6],
[7, 6, 7, 6]
]

Applying the transformation:
- The first row becomes [2, 7, 7, 2].
- The second row becomes [2, 7, 2, 7].
- The third row becomes [7, 7, 7, 2].
- The fourth row becomes [7, 2, 7, 2].

Thus, the output grid will be:
[
[2, 7, 7, 2],
[2, 7, 2, 7],
[7, 7, 7, 2],
[7, 2, 7, 2]

2024-10-04 11:32:08,150 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID b27ca6d3, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify the number 2**: The number 2 in the input grid represents a specific object or formation that needs to be transformed.
2. **Transformations**: The number 2 is replaced with the number 3 in the output grid. This transformation occurs in a way that maintains the relative positions of the 2s in the input grid.
3. **Surrounding Context**: The transformation also seems to consider the surrounding context of the 2s. If a 2 is surrounded by 0s, it remains a 2 in the output. However, if it is adjacent to other 2s, it becomes a 3.
4. **Empty Cells**: The empty cells (0s) remain unchanged in the output grid.

In summary, the transformation involves replacing the number 2 with the number 3 when it is adjacent to other 2s, while keeping the rest of the grid unchanged.

2024-10-04 11:32:20,936 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID b2862040, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. The number '9' remains unchanged throughout the transformation.
2. The number '1' is transformed into '8' in the output grid.
3. The transformation appears to be a decrement of 1 for every '1' in the input grid, changing it to '8'.
4. The number '0' (if present) would remain unchanged, but it is not present in the provided examples.
5. The transformation does not affect the '9's, which serve as boundaries or walls in the grid.

This pattern is consistent across all provided examples, where '1's are replaced with '8's while '9's remain unchanged.

2024-10-04 11:32:27,940 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID bb43febb, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. The grid is primarily filled with the number 5, which represents a certain object or formation.
2. The transformation seems to involve replacing some of the 5s with the number 2, which likely represents a different state or type of object.
3. The replacement of 5s with 2s occurs in a specific pattern:
   - In Example 1, the 5s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 2s, creating a vertical line of 2s.
   - In Example 2, the transformation is similar, where the 5s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 2s, but the pattern is slightly different, indicating that the transformation is context-dependent based on the surrounding numbers.
4. The 0s remain unchanged throughout the transformation.

From these observations, we can conclude that the transformation involves identifying a specific region of 5s and replacing them with 2s based on their position in the grid.

To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The number '5' in the input grid is transformed into '5' in the output grid, but it also gets surrounded by '8's in certain positions.
2. The transformation seems to occur primarily in the rows where '5's are present, particularly in the second and third rows of the grid.
3. The '5's that are surrounded by other '5's or are part of a larger formation of '5's are replaced with '8's, while the '5's that are on the edges or isolated remain unchanged.
4. The transformation also introduces '6's in specific positions, likely where '5's are adjacent to other '5's in a vertical arrangement.

In summary, the transformation involves:
- Replacing certain '5's with '8's based on their surrounding context.
- Introducing '6's in specific positions where '5's are vertically aligned.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test input grid:

To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The number '7' is consistently replaced by '5' in the output grids. This indicates that '7' is a target number for transformation.
2. The other numbers (1 and 8) remain unchanged in the output grids unless they are adjacent to a '7'. In that case, they do not change either.
3. The number '0' (empty cell) is not present in the examples, but it can be inferred that it would remain '0' if it were present.

From the examples, we can summarize the transformation rule as follows:
- Replace every occurrence of '7' with '5'.
- All other numbers remain unchanged.

Now, applying this transformation rule to the Test input grid:
Input Grid:
[
[1, 7, 7, 1, 7],
[8, 1, 7, 7, 7],
[8, 7, 1, 7, 8]
]

We will replace every '7' with '5':
- The first row becomes [1, 5, 5, 1, 5].
- The second row becomes [8, 1, 5, 5, 5].
- The third row becomes [8, 5, 1, 5, 8].

Thus, the output grid will be:
Output Grid:
[
[1, 5, 5, 1, 5],
[8, 1, 5, 5, 5],

2024-10-04 11:32:53,749 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID ce22a75a, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The number '5' in the input grid seems to trigger a transformation that fills certain areas of the grid with '1's.
2. The transformation appears to create horizontal and vertical lines of '1's around the position of '5'.
3. Specifically, when '5' is located at (i, j), the output grid fills:
   - The entire row (i) with '1's from column (j-2) to (j+2) (if within bounds).
   - The entire column (j) with '1's from row (i-2) to (i+2) (if within bounds).
4. If there are multiple '5's, the transformations overlap, resulting in more '1's in those areas.

Now, applying this reasoning to the test input grid:
- The '5's are located at (1, 7), (4, 1), (4, 7), and (7, 1).
- We will fill the corresponding rows and columns with '1's based on the positions of these '5's.

To identify the transformation applied in the examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The transformation seems to propagate the highest number found in each column downwards to the empty cells (0s) below it.
2. For each column, we start from the bottom-most row and move upwards. If we encounter a non-zero number, we note it as the maximum for that column. We then fill any empty cells (0s) below it with this maximum value.
3. If a column has no non-zero numbers, it remains unchanged.

Let's break down the transformation step by step:
- For each column, we check from the bottom row to the top row.
- If we find a non-zero number, we set it as the maximum for that column.
- We then fill all empty cells (0s) below this maximum with the maximum value found.
- If we reach the top of the column and there are still empty cells, they remain as 0.

Now, applying this logic to the Test input grid:
Input:
[
[4, 0, 8],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 7, 0]
]

- Column 0: The maximum is 4 (from the first row). The second and third rows are filled with 4.
- Column 1: The maximum is 7 (from the third row). The first row remains 0, and the second row is filled with 7.
- Column 2: The maximum is 8 (from the first row). The second and third rows are filled with 8.

Thus, the output grid will be:
[
[4, 7, 8],

2024-10-04 11:33:06,335 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID d2abd087, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The number '5' in the input grid is transformed into '2' in the output grid.
2. The number '0' remains '0' in the output grid.
3. The number '2' appears in the output grid where there were clusters of '5's in the input grid.
4. The number '1' appears in the output grid, replacing some of the '5's that were on the left side of the grid, indicating a shift in the representation of the clusters.

The transformation seems to involve:
- Replacing clusters of '5's with '2's.
- Replacing some of the '5's with '1's based on their position in the grid.

The output grid maintains the overall structure of the input grid but changes the values based on the above rules.

2024-10-04 11:33:13,617 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID d43fd935, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the provided examples, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Preservation of Zeros**: The empty cells (0s) remain unchanged in both the input and output grids.

2. **Grouping of Identical Numbers**: The numbers that are not zero seem to be grouped together. For instance, in Example 1, the number 1 is spread out in the input but is grouped together in the output.

3. **Vertical and Horizontal Propagation**: The numbers appear to propagate vertically and horizontally to fill adjacent empty cells. For example, in Example 2, the number 8 spreads to adjacent cells.

4. **Specific Patterns**: Certain numbers seem to have specific patterns of propagation. For instance, the number 6 in Example 1 and Example 2 appears to fill in a specific area rather than just spreading uniformly.

5. **Consolidation of Numbers**: In some cases, numbers consolidate into a single row or column, as seen with the number 3 in Example 3.

6. **Order of Operations**: The transformation appears to prioritize filling from the left to the right and top to bottom, ensuring that numbers are consolidated before moving to the next row or column.

Applying these observations, we can deduce that the transformation involves grouping and consolidating numbers while preserving the zeros.

2024-10-04 11:33:19,961 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID d5d6de2d, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The number '2' in the input grid seems to be transformed into the number '3' in the output grid.
2. The transformation appears to occur in a specific pattern:
   - The '2's that are in a continuous horizontal or vertical line are replaced by '3's in the output.
   - The '2's that are isolated or not part of a continuous line do not get transformed.
3. The output grid maintains the overall structure of the input grid, with '0's remaining '0's and only the '2's being transformed into '3's.

For example:
- In Example 1, the continuous lines of '2's in the input grid are transformed into '3's in the output grid, while isolated '2's are not transformed.
- In Example 2, the same pattern is observed where the '2's in a line are transformed into '3's.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test input grid:
- We will identify the continuous lines of '2's and replace them with '3's while keeping the '0's unchanged.

2024-10-04 11:33:40,450 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID d5d6de2d, Test Input Index 1:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify the number 2 formations**: The number 2 represents a specific formation or object on the grid. In the examples, we see that the number 2 is often grouped together in rows or columns.

2. **Transformations**: The transformation appears to replace the number 2 with the number 3 in certain patterns. Specifically, the number 3 replaces the number 2 in a way that maintains the overall structure of the formations but changes their representation.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: 
   - In Example 1, the 2s in the middle of the grid are transformed into 3s, while the surrounding areas remain 0s.
   - In Example 2, the 2s are transformed into 3s in a similar manner, but the positions of the 3s differ based on the arrangement of the 2s in the input.
   - In Example 3, the transformation is consistent with the previous examples, where the 2s are replaced with 3s, maintaining the structure.

4. **General Rule**: The transformation seems to involve identifying clusters of 2s and replacing them with 3s while ensuring that the overall grid structure remains intact.

Now, applying this analysis to the Test input grid, we will identify the clusters of 2s and replace them with 3s accordingly.

To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers in the grid represent different objects or formations. The number '2' seems to be a key object that influences the surrounding cells.

2. **Propagation of Values**: The transformation appears to involve propagating the value '1' from the cells containing '2' to their adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). This propagation continues until it reaches the edges of the grid or other non-empty cells.

3. **Handling of Other Numbers**: The numbers '7' and '5' in the grid do not seem to affect the propagation of '1' in the same way as '2'. They remain unchanged in the output grid.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: The propagation of '1' stops at the edges of the grid and does not overwrite other numbers (like '2' or '5').

5. **Final Output Structure**: The output grid retains the original structure of the input grid, with '1' filling in the cells adjacent to '2' while preserving the positions of '2', '5', and '7'.

Now, applying this transformation to the test input grid.

2024-10-04 11:34:07,374 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID dc433765, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. The transformation involves shifting the non-zero numbers (objects) in each row to the rightmost position available in that row.
2. If there are multiple non-zero numbers in a row, they are moved to the rightmost positions while maintaining their relative order.
3. The empty cells (represented by 0) are filled in from the left side of the row after the non-zero numbers have been shifted to the right.

For example, in the input grid:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```
The number 3 in the third row is shifted to the rightmost position, and the number 4 in the ninth row is also shifted to the rightmost position.

The output grid will look like this:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

2024-10-04 11:34:13,550 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID dc433765, Test Input Index 1:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. The transformation appears to involve shifting the non-zero numbers in each column of the grid downwards, while maintaining their relative order.
2. If there are empty cells (represented by 0) below a non-zero number, the non-zero number will move down to the lowest available position in its column.
3. If there are multiple non-zero numbers in a column, they will stack at the bottom of the column, with the lowest number being the last one to move down.
4. The empty cells (0s) will fill the spaces above the non-zero numbers after the shift.

For example, in the first example, the number 3 moves down to the second row, and the number 4 remains in its position since there are no empty cells below it.

Now, applying this logic to the test input:
Input:
[
[4, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3]
]

- In the first column, the number 4 is already at the top, and there are no empty cells below it, so it stays in place.
- In the second column, there are no non-zero numbers, so it remains unchanged.
- In the third column, the number 3 is at the bottom, and there are no empty cells below it, so it stays in place.

Thus, the output grid will have the same configuration as the input grid, but with the non-zero numbers shifted down as much as possible.

2024-10-04 11:34:24,773 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID ddf7fa4f, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The numbers in the grid seem to be transformed based on their positions and the presence of other numbers.
2. The transformation appears to involve replacing certain numbers with others based on their surrounding context.
3. Specifically, the numbers seem to be grouped together, and the values are shifted or replaced based on their proximity to other numbers.

For example:
- In Example 1, the number 5 is replaced with 6 in a specific area, while the number 2 is replaced with itself in another area.
- In Example 2, the number 5 is replaced with 1 in a specific area, while the number 4 is replaced with itself in another area.
- In Example 3, the number 5 is replaced with 6 in a specific area, while the number 1 is replaced with itself in another area.

The transformation seems to involve:
- Identifying clusters of numbers and replacing them with new values based on their original values and their positions in the grid.
- The transformation is consistent in that it maintains the structure of the grid while changing the values based on the rules observed.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test input grid:
- The number 5 will likely be replaced with a new value based on its context, and the numbers 3, 6, and 9 will also be transformed based on their positions.

2024-10-04 11:34:34,366 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID ded97339, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify the Number 8**: The number 8 represents a specific object or formation on the grid. We need to focus on how these numbers are arranged in the input grid.

2. **Horizontal Expansion**: In the output grid, we see that the number 8 tends to expand horizontally. For example, if there are multiple 8s in a row, they are transformed into a continuous line of 8s.

3. **Vertical Stacking**: If there are 8s in the same column, they also tend to stack vertically, creating a column of 8s.

4. **Empty Cells**: The empty cells (0s) remain unchanged unless they are adjacent to 8s, which can influence their arrangement.

5. **Overall Pattern**: The transformation seems to create a more filled and connected structure of 8s, where isolated 8s become part of a larger formation.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input grid:
- We will look for isolated 8s and connect them horizontally and vertically as per the observed pattern.

2024-10-04 11:35:07,085 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID e9614598, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The number '1' in the input grid seems to be a marker for a specific position that influences the surrounding cells.
2. The output grid introduces the number '3' in positions that are adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the '1's in the input grid.
3. If there are multiple '1's, the '3's are placed in a way that they connect the '1's, filling the space between them.
4. The '3's do not overwrite the '1's; they are placed in empty cells (0s) adjacent to the '1's.

For example:
- In Example 1, the '1's are located at (4, 1) and (4, 7). The '3's fill the cells (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), and (5, 4) to connect the '1's.
- In Example 2, the '1's are at (0, 3) and (8, 3), and the '3's fill the cells (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), and (5, 3) to connect the '1's.

The transformation can be summarized as:
- Identify the positions of '1's in the input grid.
- For each '1', place '3's in the adjacent cells (if they are empty) to create a connection between the '1's.

---Analysis End---

Now, applying this transformation to the Test input grid:

Identifying the positions of '1's:
- (3, 1) and (3, 11)

Placing '3's in adjacent cells:
- For (3, 1): Place '3' at (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 1), (3, 2)
- For (3, 11): Place '3' at (2, 11), (3, 10), (4, 11), (3, 12)

The output grid will be:

2024-10-04 11:35:17,418 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID e9614598, Test Input Index 1:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. The number '1' in the grid represents a specific object or formation.
2. The transformation appears to involve replacing certain '0's with '3's based on the positions of '1's in the grid.
3. Specifically, when a '1' is present, the cells directly below it (in the same column) are filled with '3's until a '0' is encountered.
4. The transformation does not affect the '1's themselves; they remain unchanged.
5. The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.

In the provided examples, we can see that the '3's are placed in a vertical line beneath the '1's, filling the empty cells until a '0' is reached.

Now, applying this logic to the test input grid:
- The first '1' is located at (0, 3), which means we will place '3's in the cells below it in the same column (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3) until we reach a '0'.
- The second '1' is located at (6, 3), and we will do the same for this position, placing '3's in (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3).

After applying these transformations, we will generate the output grid.

2024-10-04 11:35:27,335 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID ea32f347, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The number '5' in the input grid is transformed into '1', '2', '4', or '0' in the output grid based on its position and the surrounding numbers.
2. The transformation seems to follow a pattern where:
   - The first occurrence of '5' in a column is replaced with '1'.
   - Subsequent occurrences of '5' in the same column are replaced with '2'.
   - The last occurrence of '5' in a column is replaced with '4'.
   - Any '5' that is not the first or last in its column is replaced with '0'.
3. Empty cells (0) remain unchanged.

By applying this logic, we can systematically replace the '5's in the input grid according to their positions.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the provided Test input grid.

To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following patterns in the provided examples:

1. **Shifting Non-Zero Values**: The non-zero values in the grid seem to be shifted towards the rightmost side of their respective rows. If there are empty cells (0s), the non-zero values move to fill those spaces.

2. **Row-wise Processing**: Each row is processed independently. The non-zero values are collected and then placed at the end of the row, while the remaining cells are filled with zeros.

3. **Preservation of Order**: The order of the non-zero values is preserved as they are shifted to the right.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input grid:
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0],
[5, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 5]
]
```
- For the first row `[0, 0, 0]`, there are no non-zero values, so it remains `[0, 0, 0]`.
- For the second row `[5, 0, 0]`, the non-zero value 5 is shifted to the rightmost position, resulting in `[0, 0, 5]`.
- For the third row `[0, 5, 5]`, the non-zero values 5 and 5 are shifted to the rightmost positions, resulting in `[0, 5, 5]`.

Thus, the output grid will be:
```
[
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5],
[0, 5, 5]
]
```

2024-10-04 11:35:52,032 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID f8a8fe49, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following steps:

1. The first three rows and the last three rows of the grid remain unchanged, filled with zeros.
2. The fourth row remains unchanged.
3. The fifth row remains unchanged.
4. The sixth row has the number 5 shifted to the left, and the last two zeros are replaced with zeros.
5. The seventh row has the number 5 shifted to the left, and the last two zeros are replaced with zeros.
6. The eighth row remains unchanged.
7. The ninth row remains unchanged.
8. The tenth row remains unchanged.
9. The eleventh row remains unchanged.
10. The twelfth row remains unchanged.
11. The thirteenth row remains unchanged.
12. The fourteenth row remains unchanged.
13. The fifteenth row remains unchanged.

The transformation appears to involve shifting the numbers in the grid while maintaining the structure of zeros around them. The numbers are rearranged, but the overall shape and distribution of zeros remain consistent.

2024-10-04 11:36:03,295 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID f76d97a5, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. The transformation appears to focus on the numbers that are surrounded by other numbers of the same type. Specifically, it seems to replace certain numbers with 0 based on their surrounding context.
3. The numbers that are replaced with 0 in the output grid are those that are not part of a continuous formation of the same number. This means that if a number is isolated or surrounded by different numbers, it gets replaced by 0.
4. The numbers that remain in the output grid are those that are part of a larger cluster of the same number.

In summary, the transformation can be described as follows:
- For each cell in the grid, if the number is part of a continuous formation (i.e., it has adjacent cells with the same number), it remains unchanged. If it is isolated or surrounded by different numbers, it is replaced with 0.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test input grid:
Input:
[
[3, 3, 3, 5, 3],
[3, 5, 3, 3, 3],
[3, 5, 5, 3, 5],
[3, 3, 3, 5, 3],
[5, 5, 5, 3, 3]
]

We will analyze each cell:
- The 3s in the first row are part of a continuous formation, so they remain.
- The 5 in the first row is isolated, so it becomes 0.
- The 3s in the second row are also part of a continuous formation, but the 5 is isolated, so it becomes 0.
- The 3s in the third row are surrounded by 5s, so they remain, but the 5s are part of a continuous formation, so they remain as well.
- The 3s in the fourth row are part of a continuous formation, so they remain.
- The 5s in the last row are part of a continuous formation, so they remain.

After applying this logic, we can construct the output grid.
