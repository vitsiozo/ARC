You are a chatbot with human-like reasoning and abstraction capabilities.
We will engage in tasks that require reasoning and logic.
You will be presented with grids of colored cells. Black color representes the background and the other colors represent objects on the grid.
Follow these steps:
1. You will first receive a sample grid transformation where the input and output grids are shown as well as an analysis of the transformation.
2. You will then be presented with a novel task.
3. Carefully analyze each input-output example in the task and identify the transformation.
4. Describe the transformation step-by-step.
5. Use the marker '---Analysis Start---' before providing your analysis of the transformation.
6. Apply the identified transformation to the Test input grid to generate the output grid.
7. Use the marker '---Output Grid Start---' before providing the final output grid.
8. Use the same format as the one provided in the examples for your output grid.
9. Use the marker '---Output Grid End---' at the end of the final output grid.

To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Red Cells**: In the first example, the red cells are rearranged to form a more structured pattern. Specifically, the red cells are moved to the right and downwards, creating a more compact arrangement. The output grid has red cells forming a more defined shape.

2. **Cyan Cells**: In the second example, the cyan cells remain in their original positions, but the red cells are shifted to create a more organized structure. The output grid shows that the red cells are now more aligned and form a clearer shape.

3. **General Pattern**: The transformation seems to involve rearranging the colored cells (red and cyan) to create more defined shapes or patterns while keeping the black cells as the background. The output grids often have the colored cells more centralized or aligned compared to the input grids.

4. **Specific Changes**: 
   - The red cells are often moved to fill in gaps or to create a more compact arrangement.
   - The cyan cells are retained in their positions unless they are adjacent to red cells, in which case they may be pushed aside to allow for a clearer red structure.

In summary, the transformation involves rearranging the colored cells (red and cyan) to create more defined and compact shapes while maintaining the black background.

To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The transformation appears to involve moving colored cells (in this case, blue or red) downwards in the grid.
2. Specifically, the colored cells in each row are shifted down to the next available row below them, while maintaining their relative positions.
3. If a row is completely filled with black cells, the colored cells from the row above will move down to the next row that has black cells.
4. If there are multiple colored cells in a row, they will all move down together, and if they reach the bottom of the grid, they will occupy the lowest available positions.

For example:
- In Example 1, the blue cells in the first row move down to the second row, and the second row becomes completely black.
- In Example 2, the blue cells in the second row move down to the third row, and the second row becomes completely black.
- In Example 3, the blue cells in the first two rows move down, and the last row remains unchanged.
- In Example 4, the red cells in the first two rows move down to the second and third rows respectively.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test input grid:
Input:
[
["red", "black", "black"],
["red", "black", "black"],
["black", "black", "black"]
]

The red cells in the first two rows will move down to the next available rows. The first row will become black, the second row will have the red cells from the first row, and the third row will have the red cells from the second row.

Thus, the output grid will be:
Output:
[
["black", "black", "black"],
["red", "black", "black"],
["red", "black", "black"]

To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The transformation appears to involve moving colored cells (in this case, blue or red) downwards in the grid.
2. Specifically, the colored cells in each row are shifted down to the next available row below them, while maintaining their relative positions.
3. If a row is completely filled with black cells, the colored cells from the row above will move down to the next row that has black cells.
4. If there are multiple colored cells in a row, they will all move down together, preserving their order.

For example:
- In Example 1, the blue cells in the first row move down to the second row, and the second row becomes entirely black.
- In Example 2, the blue cells in the second row move down to the third row, and the second row becomes entirely black.
- In Example 3, the blue cells in the second row move down to the third row, while the first row becomes entirely black.
- In Example 4, the red cells in the first and second rows move down to the second and third rows respectively.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test input grid:
Input:
[
["black", "black", "black"],
["black", "blue", "black"],
["black", "black", "black"]
]

The blue cell in the second row will move down to the third row, resulting in:
Output:
[
["black", "black", "black"],
["black", "black", "black"],
["black", "blue", "black"]
]

---Output Grid Start---

["black", "blue", "black"]
