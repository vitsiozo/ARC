You are a chatbot with human-like reasoning and abstraction capabilities.
We will engage in tasks that require reasoning and logic.
You will be presented with grids of colored cells. Black color representes the background and the other colors represent objects on the grid.
Follow these steps:
1. Carefully analyze each input-output example in the task and identify the transformation.
2. Describe the transformation step-by-step.
3. Use the marker '---Analysis Start---' before providing your analysis of the transformation.
4. Apply the identified transformation to the Test input grid to generate the output grid.
5. Use the marker '---Output Grid Start---' before providing the final output grid.
6. Use the same format as the one provided in the examples for your output grid.
7. Use the marker '---Output Grid End---' at the end of the final output grid.

After analyzing the input-output examples, I've identified the following transformation:

1. The colored objects (red and cyan) are moved upwards in the grid.
2. The objects maintain their relative positions to each other.
3. The objects are moved as far up as possible without overlapping with other objects or going off the grid.
4. The background (black cells) remains unchanged except for the areas where objects have moved.

This transformation can be described as a "gravity reversal" where objects float to the top of the grid instead of falling to the bottom.

After analyzing the given examples, I've identified the following transformation:

1. The colored cells (non-black cells) are moved down by one row.
2. If a colored cell is in the bottom row, it wraps around to the top row.
3. The overall shape and arrangement of the colored cells remain the same, just shifted down.
4. Black cells fill in the spaces left by the moved colored cells.

This transformation can be described as a vertical cyclic shift downwards by one row for all non-black cells.
