To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we need to identify the pattern of changes made to the colored cells.

1. **Identifying Colors and Patterns**: 
   - The input grids contain cells colored black, red, and cyan.
   - The output grids also contain these colors, but the arrangement of red and cyan cells changes.

2. **Transformation Steps**:
   - The transformation appears to involve shifting the red and cyan cells in a way that they form contiguous blocks or patterns.
   - Specifically, the red cells seem to be moved to create a more compact arrangement, often forming a rectangular shape.
   - The cyan cells remain in their positions unless they are adjacent to red cells, in which case they may be shifted or removed to maintain the new arrangement.

3. **General Rule**:
   - The transformation seems to prioritize the arrangement of red cells, ensuring they are grouped together while maintaining the overall structure of the grid.
   - The black cells remain unchanged, serving as a background.

4. **Specific Changes**:
   - In the examples, we see that red cells are often moved up or to the left to create a more compact formation.
   - The cyan cells are less frequently moved but may be adjusted based on the new positions of the red cells.

Based on this analysis, we can apply the same transformation logic to the Test Input grid.

To analyze the transformation from the training examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The transformation appears to involve moving the colored cells (blue or red) downwards in the grid.
2. In Example 1, the blue cells in the first row are moved to the second row, and the first row is filled with black cells.
3. In Example 2, the blue cells in the second row are moved to the third row, and the second row is filled with black cells.
4. In Example 3, the blue cells in the first two rows are shifted downwards, with the first row becoming black.
5. In Example 4, the red cells in the first two rows are shifted downwards, with the first row becoming black.

From these observations, we can conclude that the transformation consists of shifting the colored cells downwards in the grid while filling the topmost row with black cells.

Step-by-step transformation:
- Identify the colored cells in the grid.
- Move each colored cell down one row.
- Fill the topmost row with black cells.

From these observations, we can conclude that the transformation consists of shifting the colored cells downwards in the grid while filling the previous row with black cells.

Step-by-step transformation:
- Identify the row containing the colored cells.
- Move that row down by one position.
- Fill the original position of the colored cells with black cells.

To analyze the transformation from the training examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Example 1**: The blue cells are moved down one row.
2. **Example 2**: The blue cells are moved up one row.
3. **Example 3**: The blue cells are moved up one row, but the position of the blue cells in the second row remains unchanged.
4. **Example 4**: The red cells are moved down one row.

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation involves moving colored cells (blue or red) vertically within the grid. Specifically, the colored cells in the second row are moved to the first row, and the colored cells in the first row are moved to the second row, while the third row remains unchanged.

The transformation can be summarized as follows:
- If a colored cell is in the first row, it moves to the second row.
- If a colored cell is in the second row, it moves to the first row.
- The third row remains unchanged.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test Input:
- The Test Input grid is:
  ```
  black|black|black
  black|blue|black
  black|black|black
  ```
- The blue cell in the second row will move to the first row, and since there are no colored cells in the first row, the first row will become:
  ```
  black|blue|black
  ```
- The second row will become:
  ```
  black|black|black
  ```
- The third row remains unchanged:
  ```
  black|black|black
  ```

Thus, the output grid will be:
```
black|blue|black

To analyze the transformation from the training examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Example 1**: The blue cells are moved down one row.
2. **Example 2**: The blue cells are moved up one row.
3. **Example 3**: The blue cells are moved up one row, but the position of the blue cells in the second row remains unchanged.
4. **Example 4**: The red cells are moved down one row.

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation involves moving colored cells (blue or red) vertically within the grid. Specifically, the colored cells in the second row are moved to the first row, and the colored cells in the first row are moved to the second row, while the third row remains unchanged.

The transformation can be summarized as follows:
- If a colored cell is in the first row, it moves to the second row.
- If a colored cell is in the second row, it moves to the first row.
- The third row remains unchanged.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test Input:
- The Test Input grid is:
  ```
  black|black|black
  black|blue|black
  black|black|black
  ```
- The blue cell in the second row will move to the first row, and since there are no colored cells in the first row, the first row will become:
  ```
  black|blue|black
  ```
- The second row will become:
  ```
  black|black|black
  ```
- The third row remains unchanged:
  ```
  black|black|black
  ```

Thus, the output grid will be:
```
black|blue|black
black|black|black
black|black|black
```
