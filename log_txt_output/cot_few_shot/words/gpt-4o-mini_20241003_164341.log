To analyze the transformation from the input grids to the output grids, we can observe the following steps:

1. **Identify the Color Movement**: The transformation appears to involve moving colored cells (non-black) upwards in the grid. Specifically, the colored cells seem to be shifted up to fill any gaps created by the black cells below them.

2. **Row-wise Processing**: The transformation is applied row by row, starting from the bottom of the grid and moving upwards. If a row contains colored cells, those cells are moved up to the nearest available position in the rows above.

3. **Maintaining Order**: The order of the colored cells is preserved during the upward movement. For example, if there are two red cells in a row, they will remain in the same relative order after the transformation.

4. **Filling Gaps**: Any gaps left by the upward movement of colored cells are filled with black cells, ensuring that the grid remains rectangular.

5. **Final Output**: The final output grid retains the same dimensions as the input grid, with the colored cells shifted upwards and black cells filling in the gaps.

Now, applying this transformation to the Test input grid:

2024-10-03 16:43:57,035 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 25ff71a9, Test Input Index 0:
To identify the transformation, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. In Example 1, the blue cells are moved from the top row to the middle row, while the black cells remain in their positions.
2. In Example 2, the blue cells are moved from the middle row to the bottom row, again keeping the black cells in their positions.
3. In Example 3, the blue cells are moved from the first column of the first row and the first column of the second row to the second column of the second row and the first column of the third row, respectively.
4. In Example 4, the red cells are moved from the first row and the second row to the second row and the third row, respectively, while the black cells remain unchanged.

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation involves moving colored cells downwards in the grid while maintaining the positions of the black cells. The colored cells seem to shift down to the next available row, and if there are multiple colored cells in a row, they are moved together.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test input:
- The red cells in the first row will move down to the second row.
- The second row will then have red cells in both the first and second columns.
- The third row remains unchanged as it is entirely black.

Thus, the transformation for the Test input will result in the following output.

1. In Example 1, the blue cells are moved from the top row to the middle row, while the black cells remain in their positions.
2. In Example 2, the blue cells are moved from the middle row to the bottom row, again keeping the black cells in their positions.
3. In Example 3, the blue cells are moved from the first column of the second row to the second column of the second row, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.
4. In Example 4, the red cells are moved from the first row to the second row and from the second row to the third row, with black cells remaining unchanged.

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation involves moving colored cells downwards in the grid while maintaining the positions of black cells. If a colored cell is in the last row, it wraps around to the first row.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test input:
- The blue cell in the second row will move down to the third row.
- Since there are no colored cells in the third row, the blue cell will wrap around to the first row.

The final output grid will have the blue cell in the third row, and the rest of the cells will remain black.
