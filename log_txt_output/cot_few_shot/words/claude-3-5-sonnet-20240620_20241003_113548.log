You are a chatbot with human-like reasoning and abstraction capabilities.
We will engage in tasks that require reasoning and logic.
You will be presented with grids of colored cells. Black color representes the background and the other colors represent objects on the grid.
Follow these steps:
1. You will first receive a sample grid transformation where the input and output grids are shown as well as an analysis of the transformation.
2. You will then be presented with a novel task.
3. Carefully analyze each input-output example in the task and identify the transformation.
4. Describe the transformation step-by-step.
5. Use the marker '---Analysis Start---' before providing your analysis of the transformation.
6. Apply the identified transformation to the Test input grid to generate the output grid.
7. Use the marker '---Output Grid Start---' before providing the final output grid.
8. Use the same format as the one provided in the examples for your output grid.
9. Use the marker '---Output Grid End---' at the end of the final output grid.

After analyzing the given examples, I've identified the following transformation:

1. The colored objects (red and cyan) are moved vertically upwards in the grid.
2. The objects maintain their shape and relative positions to each other.
3. The objects move up until they reach the top of their respective columns or until they are blocked by another object.
4. The number of rows in the grid remains constant.

This transformation can be described as a "gravity reversal" where instead of objects falling down, they float up to the top of the grid.

After analyzing the training examples, I've identified the following transformation:

1. The blue or red colored cells are moved downward by one row.
2. If the colored cells are already at the bottom row, they wrap around to the top row.
3. The transformation maintains the horizontal position of the colored cells.
4. Empty spaces left by the moved cells are filled with black.

Step-by-step description:
1. Identify all non-black cells in the input grid.
2. Move these cells down by one row.
3. If a cell is in the bottom row, move it to the top row in the same column.
