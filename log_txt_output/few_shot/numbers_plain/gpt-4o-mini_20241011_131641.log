You are a chatbot with human-like reasoning and abstraction capabilities.
We will engage in tasks that require reasoning and logic.
You will be presented with grids made up of numbers.
Number 0 represents empty cells and the other numbers represent objects or patterns on the grid.
First you will be shown some example tasks together with the identified transformation(s).
Then you will be presented with a novel task. Follow these steps:
1. Carefully analyze each input-output example in the task and identify the transformation.
2. Describe the transformation step by step.
3. Apply the identified transformation to the Test input grid to generate the output grid.
4. Use the marker '---Analysis Start---' before providing your analysis of the transformation.
5. Use the marker '---Output Grid Start---' before providing the final output grid.
6. Use the same format as the one provided in the examples for your output grid.
7. Use the marker '---Output Grid End---' at the end of the final output grid.

1. In the provided examples, the transformation involves moving color objects downwards while preserving their order.
2. The first example shows that the color 2 objects are moved down to fill the empty spaces below them, while the color 8 objects remain in their original positions.
3. The second example demonstrates a similar movement of color 2 objects downwards, while the color 8 objects are unaffected.
4. The third example also shows the movement of color 2 objects downwards, with the color 8 objects remaining in place.
5. The consistent pattern is that all color objects are moved down to the lowest available position in their respective columns, while maintaining their relative order.

Based on this analysis, the transformation to be applied to the test input is:
1. Move all color objects (2 and 8) one pixel down while preserving their order.
