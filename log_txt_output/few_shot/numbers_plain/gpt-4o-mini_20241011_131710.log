1. In the provided examples, the transformation involves moving color objects downwards while preserving their order.
2. The first example shows that the color 2 objects are moved down to fill the empty spaces below them, while the color 8 objects remain in their original positions.
3. The second example demonstrates a similar movement of color 2 objects downwards, while the color 8 objects are unaffected.
4. The third example also shows the same pattern, where color 2 objects are moved down, and the color 8 objects stay in place.
5. The transformation is consistent across all examples: move all color objects down one pixel while maintaining their order.

Now, applying this transformation to the Test Input:
- The color 2 objects in the Test Input are located at (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), and (7, 6).
- We will move these color 2 objects down to the next available empty cells (0s) below them.

The positions of the color 2 objects will be updated as follows:
- (4, 5) moves to (5, 5)
- (5, 5) moves to (6, 5)
- (6, 6) moves to (7, 6)
- (6, 7) moves to (7, 7)
- (7, 6) moves to (8, 6)

After moving the color 2 objects down, the new positions will be:
- (5, 5) becomes (5, 5)
- (6, 5) becomes (6, 5)
- (7, 6) becomes (8, 6)
- (7, 7) becomes (8, 7)

The final output grid will reflect these changes.

To identify the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The grids contain color objects represented by numbers (1, 2, etc.) and empty cells represented by 0. The transformation seems to involve the interaction between these color objects.

2. **Movement and Recoloring**: The transformation involves moving color 1 objects downwards and recoloring them to color 2. This is evident from the examples where color 1 objects are moved down and changed to color 2 when they are adjacent to color 2 objects.

3. **Preservation of Order**: The order of the objects is preserved during the movement, meaning that if there are multiple color 1 objects, they will maintain their relative positions after the transformation.

4. **Interaction with Color 2**: The transformation specifically targets color 1 objects that are adjacent to color 2 objects, indicating that the presence of color 2 triggers the recoloring and movement of color 1.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input:

```

1. **Identify Color 1 Objects**: The color 1 objects are located throughout the grid, particularly in the first four rows and the last two rows.

2. **Movement Down**: We will move the color 1 objects downwards where possible, especially those that are adjacent to color 2 objects.

3. **Recoloring**: Any color 1 object that moves down to a position adjacent to a color 2 object will be recolored to color 2.

Following these steps, we will generate the output grid.

To analyze the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: In both examples, we have color 8 objects that are present in the grid. The goal is to move these objects downwards while also introducing color 1 objects in their path.

2. **Movement of Color Objects**: The color 8 objects are moved downwards until they reach the first available empty cell (0) below them. 

3. **Recoloring**: When a color 8 object moves down, it transforms into a color 1 object in the cell it vacates. This is evident in the output grids where the color 8 objects are replaced by color 1 objects in their original positions.

4. **Preservation of Order**: The order of the color 8 objects is preserved as they move downwards. If there are multiple color 8 objects in a column, they will all move down together, maintaining their relative positions.

5. **Final Positioning**: The final output grid reflects the new positions of the color 8 objects and the newly introduced color 1 objects.

Now, applying this transformation to the test input grid:
- The color 8 objects will be moved down to the lowest available empty cells, and the cells they vacate will be filled with color 1.

To analyze the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The color objects in the grid are represented by the numbers 5 and 1. The number 5 appears to be the original color, while the number 1 is the transformed color.

2. **Determine Movement and Recoloring**: The transformation involves moving the color 5 objects downwards and recoloring them to 1. The movement is done in such a way that the objects maintain their relative order and do not overlap with other objects.

3. **Filling Gaps**: When moving the objects down, any gaps created by the movement of the objects are filled with the new color (1) until they reach the bottom of the grid or another object.

4. **Preserving Structure**: The structure of the grid is preserved, meaning that the objects do not change their horizontal positions relative to each other, only their vertical positions.

5. **Final Arrangement**: The final output grid shows the new arrangement of the objects after the transformation has been applied.

Now, applying this understanding to the Test Input grid:

To analyze the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: In the examples, we have different color objects represented by numbers (e.g., 0 for empty, 8 for one color, 6 for another, etc.). The transformation involves moving and recoloring these objects.

2. **Movement and Recoloring**: The transformation typically involves moving a color object downwards and changing its color to another specified color. The movement is done while preserving the order of the objects.

3. **Specific Patterns**: In the examples, we see that the movement is often constrained by the presence of other color objects. For instance, when moving a color 5 object down, it stops when it encounters a color 0 or another color object.

4. **Preservation of Structure**: The structure of the grid is preserved, meaning that the empty spaces (0s) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the movement of the color objects.

5. **Final Output**: The output grid reflects the new positions and colors of the objects after applying the transformations.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The test input has color 8, 6, 4, 0, and 3 objects.

2. **Movement**: The color 8 objects will be moved downwards until they encounter a color 6 object. The color 4 objects will also be moved downwards until they encounter a color 1 object.

3. **Recoloring**: As the color 8 objects move down, they will change to color 6, and the color 4 objects will change to color 0.

4. **Preservation of Order**: The order of the objects will be preserved during the movement.

Now, let's apply the identified transformation to the test input grid.

2024-10-11 13:18:16,113 - INFO - Analysis of transformations for Task ID 4347f46a, Test Input Index 0:
To analyze the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: In the examples, we have different color objects represented by numbers (e.g., 0 for empty, 8 for one color, 6 for another, etc.). The transformation involves moving and recoloring these objects.

2. **Movement and Recoloring**: The transformation typically involves moving a color object downwards and changing its color to another specified color. The movement is done while preserving the order of the objects.

3. **Specific Patterns**: In the examples, we see that the movement is often constrained by the presence of other color objects. For instance, when moving a color 5 object down, it stops when it encounters a color 0 or another color object.

4. **Preservation of Structure**: The structure of the grid is preserved, meaning that the empty spaces (0s) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the movement of the color objects.

5. **Final Output**: The output grid reflects the new positions and colors of the objects after applying the transformations.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The test input has color 8, 6, 4, 0, and 3 objects.

2. **Movement**: The color 8 objects will be moved downwards until they encounter a color 6 object. The color 4 objects will also be moved downwards until they encounter a color 1 object.

3. **Recoloring**: As the color 8 objects move down, they will change to color 6, and the color 4 objects will change to color 0.

4. **Preservation of Order**: The order of the objects will be preserved during the movement.

Now, let's apply the identified transformation to the test input grid.

To identify the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: In the examples, we see that there are two main colors involved: color 2 (represented by '2') and color 3 (represented by '3'). The transformation seems to involve extending or modifying these color objects.

2. **Transformation Steps**:
   - In the first example, we see that color 2 is being transformed into color 8 (which is a new color) in certain rows, while color 3 is also being transformed into color 8 in the lower part of the grid.
   - The transformation appears to involve extending the color 2 objects downward and changing their color to 8 when they come into contact with color 3 objects.
   - The same pattern is observed in the subsequent examples, where color 2 is transformed into color 8 in the presence of color 3.

3. **General Rule**: The transformation can be summarized as:
   - Extend color 2 objects downward until they touch color 3 objects, and change the color of the extended parts to color 8.

Now, applying this transformation to the Test Input grid:

Test Input:
```

0000000003333
0000000003333
```

- The color 2 objects (the '2's) in rows 6 to 10 will be extended downward until they touch the color 3 objects (the '3's) in rows 10 to 13.
- The color 2 objects will change to color 8 in the rows where they touch the color 3 objects.

To identify the transformation applied in the provided examples, let's analyze them step by step:

Example 1:
Input:
```
338
370
500
```
Output:
```
005
073
833
```
Transformation:
1. The numbers are rearranged such that the largest numbers move downwards while the smaller numbers move upwards.
2. The order of the numbers is preserved in their respective columns.

Example 2:
Input:
```
552
100
000
```
Output:
```
000
001
255
```
Transformation:
1. Similar to the first example, the largest numbers (5s) move downwards while the smaller numbers (0s and 1s) move upwards.
2. The order of the numbers is preserved in their respective columns.

From both examples, we can conclude that the transformation involves moving all non-zero numbers downwards in their respective columns while preserving their order.

---Output Grid Start---
Applying the identified transformation to the Test Input:
Input:
```
635
680
400
```
1. The non-zero numbers in each column are:
   - Column 1: 6, 6, 4
   - Column 2: 3, 8, 0
   - Column 3: 5, 0, 0
2. Moving these numbers downwards while preserving their order gives:
   - Column 1: 0, 4, 6
   - Column 2: 0, 3, 8
   - Column 3: 0, 5, 0

Thus, the output grid will be:

To identify the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can analyze the changes made to the grids step by step.

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     330
     030
     303
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     880
     080
     303
     ```
   - Transformation: The color 3 objects are transformed into color 8 objects. The transformation appears to involve changing color 3 to color 8 while preserving the positions of the other numbers.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     030003
     033300
     000030
     030000
     ```
   - Output:

     080003
     088800
     000030
     030000
     ```
   - Transformation: Similar to Example 1, color 3 objects are transformed into color 8 objects. The transformation is applied to the entire row of color 3 objects.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     3303
     3300
     3003
     0033
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     8803
     8800
     8008
     0088
     ```
   - Transformation: Again, color 3 objects are transformed into color 8 objects, with the same pattern of transformation applied to all occurrences of color 3.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     330000
     030030
     300000
     033000
     033003
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     880000
     080030
     300000
     088000
     088003
     ```
   - Transformation: The same transformation is applied, changing color 3 to color 8 while maintaining the structure of the grid.

From the analysis, we can conclude that the transformation involves changing all instances of color 3 to color 8 while keeping the positions of other numbers intact.

Now, applying this transformation to the Test Input:

Test Input:
```
30303
33300
00003

     030003
     033300
     000030

     ```
   - Transformation: Similar to Example 1, color 3 objects are transformed into color 8 objects. The transformation is applied to the entire row of color 3 objects.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     3303
     3300
     3003
     0033
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     8803
     8800
     8008
     0088
     ```
   - Transformation: Again, color 3 objects are transformed into color 8 objects, with the same pattern of transformation applied to all occurrences of color 3.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     330000
     030030
     300000
     033000
     033003
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     880000
     080030
     300000
     088000
     088003
     ```
   - Transformation: The same transformation is applied, changing color 3 to color 8 while maintaining the structure of the grid.

From the analysis, we can conclude that the transformation involves changing all instances of color 3 to color 8 while keeping the positions of other numbers intact.

Now, applying this transformation to the Test Input:

Test Input:
```
30303
33300
00003
03300
03300
```

1. Identify all instances of color 3 in the grid.
2. Change all instances of color 3 to color 8.

After applying the transformation, the output grid will be:

To analyze the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify the Color Objects**: In the input grids, we need to identify the different color objects represented by numbers. Each number represents a distinct color.

2. **Rearrangement of Colors**: The transformation appears to involve rearranging the colors in a specific manner. In the examples, it seems that the colors are being shifted downwards while maintaining their relative order.

3. **Preservation of Order**: The order of the colors is preserved during the transformation. This means that if a color appears before another in the original grid, it will still appear before it in the transformed grid.

4. **Handling of Empty Spaces**: The empty spaces (represented by 0) are filled in as colors are moved down. If a color moves down into an empty space, it occupies that space, and the colors above it will continue to move down if there are no other colors blocking them.

5. **Final Arrangement**: The final output grid is constructed by moving all color objects down one pixel while preserving their order, filling in any gaps created by the movement.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input grid:

Test Input:
```
761
676
622
```

1. The colors present are 7, 6, and 2.
2. We will move each color down one pixel, preserving their order.
3. The first row (761) will move down to the second row, the second row (676) will move down to the third row, and the third row (622) will move down to the fourth row, but since there are only three rows, the first row will become empty.
4. The final arrangement will be:
   - The first row will be empty (0s).
   - The second row will contain the original first row (761).
   - The third row will contain the original second row (676).
   - The fourth row will contain the original third row (622).

Thus, the output grid will be:

```
000

1. In the provided examples, the transformation involves moving color objects downwards while preserving their order and changing their colors based on specific rules.
2. In Example 1, the color 5 objects are moved down to fill the empty spaces below them, while the color 2 objects remain in their positions.
3. In Example 2, the color 2 objects are moved down, and the color 5 objects are also moved down, but they are recolored to 0 in the process.
4. In Example 3, the color 5 objects are moved down, and the color 2 objects are also moved down, with the color 0 filling in the gaps.
5. The overall pattern indicates that all non-zero objects are moved down to the lowest available position in their respective columns, while maintaining their order.

Based on this analysis, the transformation can be summarized as:
1. Move all non-zero color objects downwards in their respective columns to fill empty spaces (0s) below them, while preserving their order.

1. In the provided examples, the transformation involves moving the color 4 objects downwards while preserving their order and structure.
2. The first example shows that the color 4 objects in the upper part of the grid are moved down to create space for the color 1 objects, which are introduced in the middle of the grid.
3. The second example also demonstrates a similar movement of color 4 objects downwards, with the introduction of color 2 objects in the middle rows.
4. The key aspect of the transformation is that the color 4 objects are moved down to fill the empty spaces created by the introduction of new colors, while maintaining their original arrangement.
5. The transformation can be summarized as: Move all color 4 objects down one pixel while preserving their order, and introduce color 2 or color 1 objects in the appropriate positions.

To identify the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Color Recoloring**: In both examples, the color '1' is transformed into color '2'. This indicates that the transformation involves changing the color of certain objects on the grid.

2. **Object Movement**: The objects of color '1' are moved downwards in the grid. This movement is consistent across the examples, where the objects maintain their relative order as they are shifted down.

3. **Preservation of Structure**: The empty cells (0s) remain unchanged, and the objects that are moved down do not overlap with other objects, ensuring that the structure of the grid is preserved.

4. **Final Positioning**: The final output shows that the objects of color '1' have been moved down to the lowest available positions while being recolored to '2'.

Now, applying this reasoning to the test input:

1. Identify all objects of color '1' in the test input grid.
2. Move each identified object down to the lowest available position in their respective columns.
3. Recolor the moved objects from '1' to '2'.

To identify the transformation applied in the training examples, let's analyze the provided examples step by step:

1. **Example 1 Analysis**:
   - The input grid has a color 8 object that is surrounded by empty cells and a color 0 object.
   - The output grid shows that the color 8 object has been transformed into color 2 in certain areas, while maintaining the overall structure.
   - The transformation appears to involve extending the color 8 object downwards and recoloring it to color 2 in a specific pattern.

2. **Example 2 Analysis**:
   - The input grid has a color 8 object with some color 0 cells.
   - The output shows that the color 8 object has been transformed into color 2 in a similar manner, with some parts of the object being recolored and extended.

3. **Example 3 Analysis**:
   - The input grid has a color 8 object that is transformed into color 2 in a structured way, with the color 2 object extending downwards and maintaining the order of the original color 8 object.

From these analyses, we can summarize the transformation as follows:
- The transformation involves extending the color 8 objects downwards and recoloring them to color 2 while maintaining the structure and order of the original objects.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the Test Input grid.

To analyze the transformation applied in the training examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The grids contain color objects represented by numbers (e.g., 5). We need to identify the positions of these objects in the grid.

2. **Recoloring and Movement**: The transformation involves moving color objects downwards and recoloring them. Specifically, the color 5 objects are transformed into color 2 and 0, while color 0 is transformed into color 1.

3. **Preserving Order**: When moving the objects down, the order of the objects must be preserved. This means that if there are multiple objects of the same color, they should maintain their relative positions after the transformation.

4. **Filling Gaps**: As objects are moved down, any gaps created in the grid must be filled with the appropriate colors, ensuring that the grid remains filled correctly.

5. **Final Output**: The final output grid reflects the new positions and colors of the objects after applying the transformations.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input grid:

Test Input:
```

5000000000
5005500500
5000000500
0000000000
```

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The color 5 objects are located at various positions in the grid.

2. **Recoloring and Movement**: 
   - The color 5 objects will be moved down and recolored to color 2.
   - The empty spaces (0) will be filled with color 1 as the objects move down.

3. **Preserving Order**: The order of the color 5 objects will be preserved as they are moved down.

4. **Filling Gaps**: As the objects are moved down, we will fill any gaps with the appropriate colors.

Following these steps, we will generate the output grid.

To identify the transformation applied in the training examples, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs step by step.

Example 1:
Input:
```
221
151
522
```
Output:
```
215
252
112
```
Transformation:
1. The first row changes from `221` to `215`, indicating that the first '2' has been replaced by '1' and the last '1' has been replaced by '5'.
2. The second row changes from `151` to `252`, where '1' is replaced by '2' and '5' is replaced by '2'.
3. The third row changes from `522` to `112`, where '5' is replaced by '1' and '2' remains unchanged.

Example 2:
Input:
```
225
622
555
```
Output:
```
265
225
525
```
Transformation:
1. The first row changes from `225` to `265`, where '2' is replaced by '6'.
2. The second row remains `622` to `225`, where '6' is replaced by '2'.
3. The third row changes from `555` to `525`, where the first '5' is replaced by '2'.

Example 3:
Input:
```
995
558
589
```
Output:
```
955
958
589
```
Transformation:
1. The first row changes from `995` to `955`, where the first '9' is replaced by '5'.
2. The second row changes from `558` to `958`, where the first '5' is replaced by '9'.
3. The third row remains unchanged.

Example 4:
Input:
```
266
211
262
```
Output:
```
222
616
612
```
Transformation:
1. The first row changes from `266` to `222`, where '6' is replaced by '2'.
2. The second row changes from `211` to `616`, where '2' is replaced by '6'.
3. The third row changes from `262` to `612`, where '2' is replaced by '6'.

From the analysis, the transformation appears to involve a combination of replacing certain numbers with others, possibly based on their positions or neighboring values.

Now, applying this reasoning to the Test Input:
Test Input:
```
934
944
934
```
We will analyze the numbers and see if we can apply a similar transformation.

1. The first row `934` could potentially change based on the presence of '9' and '4'.
2. The second row `944` has two '4's, which might influence the transformation.
3. The third row `934` is identical to the first row.

Based on the patterns observed, we can hypothesize that:
- '9' might be replaced by '5' (as seen in previous examples).
- '4' might remain or change based on its context.

After analyzing the patterns, we can apply a similar transformation to the Test Input.

To analyze the transformation applied in the training examples, we can identify the following steps:

1. **Identify the Color Objects**: The grids contain different color objects represented by numbers. In the examples, we see colors 0, 5, 6, 7, and 8 being manipulated.

2. **Movement and Recoloring**: The transformation often involves moving color objects downwards while preserving their order. In some cases, the objects are recolored or merged with other colors.

3. **Filling Empty Spaces**: The transformation also seems to involve filling empty spaces (represented by 0) with the color objects as they move down.

4. **Final Arrangement**: The final output grid shows the color objects arranged in a way that they occupy the lowest available positions in their respective columns.

In the provided examples, the transformation can be summarized as:
- Move all color objects downwards to fill empty spaces while maintaining their order.

To identify the transformation applied in the training examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The transformation seems to involve identifying clusters of a specific color (in this case, color 1) and expanding them into a new color (color 3) while maintaining the structure of the original grid.
2. The clusters of color 1 are replaced with color 3 in a way that they expand outward, filling in the surrounding empty cells (0s) until they reach the boundaries of the cluster or another color.
3. The transformation preserves the original structure of the grid, meaning that the positions of other colors (like 0s and 2s) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the expansion of color 1.

In the provided examples, we can summarize the transformation as follows:
- Identify clusters of color 1.
- Replace color 1 with color 3 in the identified clusters, expanding into adjacent empty cells (0s) until they reach the boundaries of the cluster.

Now, applying this transformation to the Test Input grid:

Test Input:
```

000010001000
000011111000
000000000000
```

1. Identify clusters of color 1:
   - The first cluster is located in the last five columns of the first row and the second row.
   - The second cluster is located in the second and third rows, where color 1 is present in a cross-like shape.

2. Replace color 1 with color 3:
   - The first cluster will expand into the surrounding empty cells (0s) in the first five rows, filling them with color 3.
   - The second cluster will also expand into the surrounding empty cells (0s) in the second and third rows.

After applying the transformation, the output grid will look like this:

1. In the provided examples, the transformation involves moving color objects downwards while preserving their order and filling in the empty spaces with the appropriate colors.
2. The first example shows that color 2 objects are moved down to fill the empty spaces below them, and the same is done for color 1 and color 3 objects.
3. The second example demonstrates a similar downward movement of color objects, where color 6, 1, and 2 are moved down to fill the empty spaces.
4. The third example also follows the same pattern, where color objects are moved down to fill the empty spaces while maintaining their order.

The transformation can be summarized as:
- Move all color objects downwards in the grid while preserving their order, filling in the empty spaces (0s) as they move down.

To analyze the transformation applied in the training examples, we can summarize the key steps observed:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The transformation involves identifying specific color objects (in this case, colors 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8) on the grid.

2. **Extend and Recolor**: The transformation often involves extending the color objects downward and recoloring them. For example, color 3 is transformed into color 6, and color 0 is transformed into color 4.

3. **Preserve Order**: The order of the objects is preserved while they are moved downwards.

4. **Fill Empty Spaces**: The empty spaces (0s) are filled with the new colors as the objects are moved down.

5. **Pattern Recognition**: The transformation seems to follow a pattern where certain colors are replaced or extended based on their proximity to other colors.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input:

- The grid contains a color 3 object at (1, 0) and a color 2 object at (10, 12). 
- The color 3 object will be extended downwards and recolored to color 6.
- The color 2 object will also be extended downwards and recolored to color 4.

Following these steps, we will apply the transformation to the test input grid.

To analyze the transformation applied in the training examples, we can identify a consistent pattern:

1. The transformation involves changing the color of certain objects (in this case, color 2) to color 1 when they are adjacent to color 1 objects.
2. The transformation appears to extend the influence of color 1 downwards and horizontally, creating a new pattern where color 1 replaces color 2 in specific areas.
3. The transformation maintains the overall structure of the grid while modifying the colors based on their adjacency to other colors.

In the provided examples, we see that:
- Color 2 objects that are adjacent to color 1 objects are transformed into color 1.
- The transformation is applied in a way that respects the original layout of the grid, ensuring that the order and position of the objects are preserved.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input grid:

Test Input:
```
002222200
002000200

202020000
200022222
222220000
000020000
```

We will look for color 1 objects and see how they can influence the adjacent color 2 objects.

1. The first row has color 2 objects that are adjacent to color 1 objects in the second row.
2. The second row has color 2 objects that are adjacent to color 1 objects in the first row and the fourth row.
3. The fourth row has a continuous line of color 2 objects that will be influenced by the color 1 objects above.

Following the transformation rules identified, we will change the color 2 objects that are adjacent to color 1 objects to color 1.

To identify the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The grids contain color objects represented by numbers (1, 2, etc.) and empty cells represented by 0. The transformation involves moving and recoloring these objects.

2. **Movement and Recoloring**: The transformation appears to involve moving color objects downwards while also changing their color. Specifically, when a color object (like 1) is moved down, it is recolored to the next color (like 2).

3. **Preserving Order**: The order of the objects is preserved during the movement. If there are multiple objects in a column, they are moved down in the same order they appear.

4. **Handling Empty Cells**: The empty cells (0) allow for the movement of the color objects downwards until they reach the bottom of the grid or another object.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input:

Test Input:
```
0101000000
0000000000

0000000000
0001010000
0000000000
0000000000
```

1. **Move Color 1 Objects Down**: 
   - The first column has a 1 at (0,1) which can move down to (1,1) and then to (2,1).
   - The second column has a 1 at (0,3) which can move down to (1,3) and then to (2,3).
   - The third column has a 1 at (2,2) which can move down to (3,2).
   - The fourth column has a 1 at (2,4) which can move down to (3,4).
   - The fifth column has a 1 at (4,1) which can move down to (5,1).
   - The sixth column has a 1 at (5,5) which can move down to (6,5).
   - The seventh column has a 1 at (7,2) which can move down to (8,2).

2. **Recoloring**: 
   - After moving, the 1s will be recolored to 2s.

Following these steps, we can generate the output grid.

1. In the first example, the transformation involves moving the color 8 objects down and recoloring them to color 2. The color 8 objects are in the first two rows, and they are moved down to the third and fourth rows, where they become color 2.
2. In the second example, a single color 8 object is moved down to the second row and recolored to color 2.
3. In the third example, the color 8 objects in the second row are moved down to the third row and recolored to color 2, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.

From these examples, we can summarize the transformation as follows:
- Move all color 8 objects down one pixel while preserving their order.
- Recolor the moved objects to color 2.

1. In the provided examples, the transformation involves moving color objects downwards while also recoloring them.
2. Specifically, the color 0 objects (empty cells) are replaced by the color 2 or 3 objects (depending on the example) as they move down.
3. The movement is done in such a way that the objects maintain their relative order, and the new color fills the space left by the original color.
4. The transformation also involves extending the color objects to fill the space below them until they reach the bottom of the grid or another object.

To analyze the transformation applied in the training examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The grids contain different color objects represented by numbers (e.g., 0 for empty, 1, 2, 3, 7 for different colors).
2. **Movement and Recoloring**: The transformation involves moving color objects downwards while also changing their color based on their position relative to other color objects.
3. **Preservation of Order**: When moving the objects, their relative order must be preserved, meaning that if one object is above another, it should remain above after the transformation.
4. **Interaction with Other Colors**: The transformation also involves interactions between different colors, where a color may change based on its proximity to another color.

In the provided examples, we see that:
- Color 3 objects are moved down and may change to color 2 when they come into contact with color 2 objects.
- Color 7 objects are also moved down and may change to color 1 when they come into contact with color 1 objects.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input grid:

Test Input:

000000000000000
000000000000000
```

1. **Move Color 3 Objects**: The color 3 objects in the first row will move down to the next available empty space.
2. **Move Color 2 Objects**: The color 2 objects will also move down to fill the spaces below them.
3. **Move Color 7 Objects**: The color 7 objects will move down as well, and if they come into contact with color 1, they may change to color 1.

Following these steps, we will generate the output grid.

To identify the transformation applied in the training examples, we can analyze the changes made to the grids step by step:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     022
     022
     200
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     022
     022
     100
     ```
   - Transformation: The color 2 object in the last row (200) is changed to color 1 (100), indicating that the color 2 object is replaced by color 1.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     2220
     0200
     0002
     0200
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     2220
     0200
     0001
     0100
     ```
   - Transformation: The color 2 object in the last row (0002) is changed to color 1 (0001), and the color 2 object in the second last row (0200) is changed to color 1 (0100).

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     2200
     0200
     2202
     0000
     0222
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     2200
     0200
     2201
     0000
     0222
     ```
   - Transformation: The color 2 object in the third row (2202) is changed to color 1 (2201).

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     220
     202
     020
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     220
     201
     010
     ```
   - Transformation: The color 2 object in the second row (202) is changed to color 1 (201), and the color 2 object in the last row (020) is changed to color 1 (010).

From the analysis, the transformation can be summarized as:
1. Identify the lowest row containing a color 2 object.
2. Change the color 2 object in that row to color 1.
3. If there are multiple color 2 objects in the same row, only the rightmost one is changed to color 1.

---Output Grid Start---
Applying the identified transformation to the Test Input:
```
2202
0200
0020
2000
0022
```
1. The lowest row containing a color 2 object is the first row (2202), and the rightmost color 2 object is at the last column.
2. Change the rightmost color 2 object in the first row to color 1, resulting in (2201).
3. The second row (0200) has a color 2 object, change it to color 1 (0100).
4. The third row (0020) has a color 2 object, change it to color 1 (0010).
5. The fourth row (2000) has a color 2 object, change it to color 1 (1000).
6. The last row (0022) has a color 2 object, change it to color 1 (0011).

Final output grid:
```
2201

   - Transformation: The color 2 object in the second row (202) is changed to color 1 (201), and the color 2 object in the last row (020) is changed to color 1 (010).

From the analysis, the transformation can be summarized as:
1. Identify the lowest row containing a color 2 object.
2. Change the color 2 object in that row to color 1.
3. If there are multiple color 2 objects in the same row, only the rightmost one is changed to color 1.

To identify the transformation applied in the provided examples, let's analyze the input-output pairs step by step:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     6676
     6677
     7767
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     2272
     2277
     7727
     ```
   - Transformation: The color 6 objects are replaced with color 2 objects, and the color 7 objects remain unchanged. The transformation appears to involve a recoloring of the 6s to 2s while maintaining the structure of the grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     7776
     6676
     7767
     7677
     7676
     6667
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     7772
     2272
     7727
     7277
     7272
     2227
     ```
   - Transformation: Similar to Example 1, the color 6 objects are replaced with color 2 objects, while the color 7 objects remain unchanged. The transformation is consistent with the previous example.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     776666
     676777
     767767
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     772222
     272777
     727727
     ```
   - Transformation: Again, the color 6 objects are replaced with color 2 objects, while the color 7 objects remain unchanged.

From the analysis, we can conclude that the transformation applied in all examples is:
1. Replace all instances of color 6 with color 2 while keeping the other colors (in this case, color 7) unchanged.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the Test Input grid.

Test Input:
```
6776
6767
7776
7676
```

Applying the transformation:
- Replace all 6s with 2s:
```
6776  ->  2772
6767  ->  2727
7776  ->  7772
7676  ->  7272
```

Thus, the output grid will be:

To analyze the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The transformation involves identifying color objects (numbers other than 0) on the grid. In the examples, we see colors 2 and 3 being transformed.

2. **Extend and Recolor**: The transformation appears to involve extending the color objects and recoloring them. For instance, in the first example, color 2 objects are transformed into color 3 objects as they extend towards each other.

3. **Preserve Order**: The order of the objects is preserved while they are being transformed. This means that if there are multiple objects of the same color, they will maintain their relative positions after the transformation.

4. **Movement and Interaction**: The transformation also involves moving the color objects downwards and interacting with other color objects, which leads to the recoloring.

5. **Final Output**: The final output grid reflects the new positions and colors of the objects after applying the transformations.

In summary, the transformation involves:
- Identifying color objects.
- Extending and recoloring them based on their interactions.
- Preserving their order and relative positions.

To analyze the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can identify a consistent pattern of modifying the grid based on the presence of certain numbers, particularly the number 1, which seems to be the focus of the transformation.

1. In the first example, the number 1 is transformed into the number 8 when it is surrounded by 9s, indicating a change in the color or value of the object.
2. The transformation appears to involve a downward movement of the number 1s, where they are replaced by 8s, and the surrounding 9s are adjusted accordingly.
3. The transformation also seems to involve a cascading effect, where the changes propagate through the grid, affecting adjacent cells.

The transformation can be summarized as follows:
- Identify all instances of the number 1 in the grid.
- Replace the number 1 with the number 8 if it is surrounded by 9s.
- Maintain the overall structure of the grid while applying these changes.

Now, applying this transformation to the Test Input grid:
1. Identify all instances of the number 1.
2. Replace them with 8s where applicable, considering their surrounding numbers.

Test Input:
```

After analyzing the grid, we will replace the 1s with 8s where they are surrounded by 9s.

1. In the first example, the transformation involves changing the color of the objects from 5 to 2 in a specific pattern. The color 5 objects are moved downwards and recolored to 2, while maintaining their relative positions.
2. In the second example, the transformation is similar, where the color 5 objects are moved downwards and recolored to 2, but the movement is limited to the area where there are no other objects blocking the way.
3. The transformation can be summarized as moving the color 5 objects downwards into the empty spaces (0s) and changing their color to 2 when they reach the bottom or when they are adjacent to other color 5 objects.
4. The output grid reflects the new positions and colors of the objects after applying the transformation.

To identify the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The main color object in the examples is color 5, which is surrounded by color 0 (empty cells) and color 0 is also the background.

2. **Recoloring and Extending**: In the examples, the color 5 objects are being transformed into color 8 objects. This transformation occurs when the color 5 objects are adjacent to color 0 cells, and they extend downwards or sideways to fill the empty spaces, while also changing their color to 8.

3. **Preserving Structure**: The structure of the color 5 objects is preserved while they are being transformed into color 8. The transformation seems to occur in a way that the color 5 objects that are in the same row or column as the color 0 cells are the ones that get transformed.

4. **Movement**: The color 5 objects are also moving downwards in some cases, as seen in the examples, where they are replaced by color 8 in the rows below.

5. **Final Output**: The final output retains the original structure of the grid while applying the transformations to the color 5 objects.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input grid:

Test Input:
```
000000000000
055555000000

000055550000
000050050000
000050050000
000055550000
```

1. The color 5 objects will be transformed into color 8 objects where they can extend into empty spaces (0).
2. The transformation will occur in the rows below where color 5 is present, and they will be replaced by color 8 while maintaining their structure.

To analyze the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The grids contain different color objects represented by numbers. In the examples, we see colors 5 and 0 primarily.

2. **Recoloring and Movement**: The transformation involves moving and recoloring the objects. For instance, in the first example, the color 5 objects are transformed into color 2 objects, and they are moved downwards while maintaining their relative positions.

3. **Extending and Merging**: In some cases, the transformation involves extending the color objects until they touch other color objects. This is evident in the first example where color 5 is transformed into color 2 and moved down.

4. **Preserving Order**: The order of the objects is preserved during the transformation, meaning that if two objects are adjacent, they remain adjacent after the transformation.

5. **Final Output**: The final output grid reflects the new positions and colors of the objects after applying the transformations.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input grid:

```

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The grid contains color 5 objects that need to be transformed.

2. **Movement and Recoloring**: The color 5 objects will be moved down and recolored to color 2, similar to the previous examples.

3. **Apply Transformation**: 
   - Move all color 5 objects down by one row.
   - Recolor them to color 2.

Following these steps, we will generate the output grid.

To analyze the transformation applied in the training examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The grids contain different color objects represented by numbers. The transformation involves moving and merging these objects based on their colors.

2. **Movement and Merging**: The transformation typically involves moving color objects downwards and merging them with other objects of the same color. This is evident in the examples where color objects are shifted down and their colors are adjusted accordingly.

3. **Preservation of Order**: When moving the objects, the order of the objects is preserved. This means that if there are multiple objects of the same color, they will maintain their relative positions after the transformation.

4. **Recoloring**: In some cases, the color of the objects is changed to match the color of the object they are merging with, as seen in the examples.

5. **Final Arrangement**: The final output grid shows the new arrangement of the objects after applying the transformations, ensuring that all objects are in their new positions and colors.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input grid:

```

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The grid contains color objects 2, 6, and 3.
2. **Move Color Objects Down**: 
   - The color 2 objects will move down to fill the empty spaces below them.
   - The color 6 objects will also move down.
   - The color 3 objects will remain in their positions as they are already at the bottom.
3. **Merge and Recolor**: 
   - As the color 2 objects move down, they will merge with any other color 2 objects they encounter.
   - The color 6 objects will also merge with any other color 6 objects they encounter.

Following these steps, we can generate the output grid.

To analyze the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can summarize the steps as follows:

1. **Identify the Color Objects**: The transformation focuses on color objects, specifically color 2 and color 3 in the examples. The color 2 objects are typically surrounded by color 0 (empty cells) and are part of a larger structure.

2. **Recoloring and Moving**: The transformation involves moving the color 2 objects downwards and recoloring them to color 3. This is done while maintaining the structure and order of the objects.

3. **Filling the Gaps**: The transformation also involves filling the gaps created by moving the objects downwards, ensuring that the new positions of the objects are contiguous and do not leave empty spaces.

4. **Final Structure**: The final output shows that the color 3 objects are positioned lower in the grid, and the original color 2 objects are transformed into color 3.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input:

- The test input has several color 2 objects that need to be moved down and recolored to color 3.
- The color 2 objects are located in the first three rows and need to be moved down to fill the empty spaces below.

To analyze the transformation applied in the training examples, we can summarize the steps as follows:

1. **Identify the Color Objects**: The color objects are represented by the number 2 in the grid. The surrounding structure of these objects is made up of 2s forming a pattern.

2. **Determine the Movement**: The transformation involves moving the color 2 objects downwards in the grid while preserving their relative order. This means that all instances of color 2 will shift down until they reach the lowest possible empty space (represented by 0) in their respective columns.

3. **Recoloring**: In the output, the color 2 objects are transformed into color 3 objects (represented by the number 3) as they move down.

4. **Empty Spaces**: The spaces that were previously occupied by the color 2 objects become empty (0) after the movement.

5. **Final Arrangement**: The final output grid reflects the new positions of the color 3 objects after the downward movement.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input grid, we will move all color 2 objects downwards and recolor them to color 3.

To analyze the transformation applied in the training examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The grids contain different color objects represented by numbers. The transformation involves moving and changing these colors based on their positions.

2. **Extend and Recolor**: In the first example, the color 2 object is surrounded by color 1 objects, which are extended to fill the area around the color 2 object. The color 1 objects are transformed into color 2 as they extend.

3. **Movement and Recoloring**: In the second example, color 3 and color 8 objects remain unchanged, while color 1 objects are moved down and recolored to color 2.

4. **Filling and Recoloring**: In the third example, the color 2 object is transformed into color 1, and the surrounding area is filled with color 1.

5. **General Pattern**: The transformation generally involves moving color objects downwards, filling empty spaces, and changing colors based on proximity to other color objects.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input:

- The grid has color 7 and color 2 objects.
- The color 7 object at the top will likely influence the area below it, while the color 2 object will also influence its surroundings.

Steps to apply the transformation:

1. **Move Color 2 Down**: The color 2 object at (3, 8) will move down to (4, 8) and then to (5, 8) if there are no obstacles.
2. **Fill with Color 1**: The area around the color 2 object will be filled with color 1 as it moves down.
3. **Recolor Color 7**: The color 7 object will remain unchanged, but the area below it will be filled with color 1.

Following these steps, we will generate the output grid.

1. In the provided examples, the transformation involves moving color 3 objects downwards in the grid while preserving their order.
2. The color 4 objects remain in their original position and do not move.
3. The movement occurs until the color 3 objects reach the lowest possible empty row in their respective columns.
4. The transformation is consistent across all examples, where color 3 is moved down and color 4 remains stationary.

To analyze the transformation applied in the training examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: In the provided examples, we see that certain colors (numbers) are grouped together in specific patterns. The transformation often involves changing the color of these objects or moving them.

2. **Recoloring and Moving**: The transformation typically involves moving color objects downwards and recoloring them. For instance, in the first example, color 5 objects are transformed into color 6 objects, and in the second example, color 5 objects are transformed into color 1 objects.

3. **Preserving Order**: When moving the objects, the order of the colors is preserved. This means that if there are multiple objects of the same color, they will maintain their relative positions after the transformation.

4. **Extending Colors**: In some cases, colors are extended to fill empty spaces until they reach another color. This is evident in the first example where color 5 is extended to become color 6.

5. **Final Output Structure**: The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid, and the transformations are applied in a way that respects the grid's structure.

Now, applying this understanding to the test input grid:

```

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The colors present are 3, 0, 5, and 9. The color 5 objects are in a block and need to be transformed.

2. **Recoloring and Moving**: The color 5 objects will be transformed into color 6 objects, and they will be moved downwards to fill the empty spaces.

3. **Preserving Order**: The order of the color 5 objects will be preserved as they are transformed into color 6.

4. **Extending Colors**: The color 5 objects will extend downwards until they reach the bottom of the grid or another color.

Following these steps, we can generate the output grid.

To analyze the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can summarize the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color 8 Objects**: The transformation focuses on the color 8 objects present in the grid. These objects are the primary elements that will be expanded or transformed.

2. **Expand Color 8 Objects**: The color 8 objects are expanded horizontally and vertically to fill the surrounding empty cells (represented by 0) until they touch each other or reach the edge of the grid.

3. **Preserve Order**: The order of the color 8 objects is preserved during the expansion. If there are multiple color 8 objects, they will expand independently but will not overlap.

4. **Fill with Color 8**: The empty cells (0) that are adjacent to the color 8 objects will be filled with color 8, effectively creating a larger contiguous area of color 8.

5. **Final Output**: The final output grid will show the expanded areas of color 8 while maintaining the original positions of other colors and empty cells.

Now, applying this transformation to the Test Input grid:

1. In the provided examples, the transformation involves extending the color 1 objects (represented by '1') downwards until they touch the bottom of the grid or another object.
2. When the color 1 objects are extended, they are recolored to color 3 (represented by '3') in the process.
3. The extension occurs in a way that maintains the original structure of the grid, ensuring that the new color 3 objects are placed directly below the original color 1 objects.
4. The output grid reflects this transformation, showing the new positions of the color 3 objects while preserving the original color 1 objects in their respective positions.

For the test input:
- There are two color 1 objects located at (3, 1) and (3, 11).
- We will extend these objects downwards until they reach the bottom of the grid.

1. In the provided examples, the transformation involves moving color 1 objects (represented by the number 1) downwards in the grid while preserving their order.
2. When a color 1 object is moved down, it is replaced with color 3 (represented by the number 3) in the row it moves to, and the original position of the color 1 object is filled with 0 (empty).
3. The movement continues until the color 1 objects reach the bottom of the grid, and if there are multiple color 1 objects, they maintain their relative positions as they move down.
4. The output grid reflects these changes, with the color 1 objects transformed into color 3 objects in their new positions.

Now, applying this transformation to the Test Input grid:
- The first color 1 object in the first row will move down to the fourth row, and the second color 1 object in the seventh row will move down to the tenth row.
- The original positions of these color 1 objects will be replaced with 0s.

To analyze the transformation applied in the provided examples, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. **Identify Color Objects**: The transformation involves identifying color objects (numbers other than 0) on the grid. In the examples, we see colors 5 and 0 being transformed into colors 1, 2, and 4.

2. **Move and Recolor**: The transformation typically involves moving the identified color objects downwards and recoloring them. The color 5 objects are moved down and transformed into color 1, while the color 0 cells remain empty.

3. **Preserve Order**: The order of the objects is preserved during the transformation. For instance, if there are multiple color 5 objects stacked, they will be transformed into color 1 in the same order.

4. **Fill Downwards**: The transformation fills the empty spaces below the color objects with the new color, ensuring that the new color objects are placed directly above the empty cells.

5. **Final Output**: The final output grid reflects these transformations, with the new colors in their respective positions.

Now, applying this understanding to the Test Input grid:

Test Input:
```
0000000000
0005000000

5555500000
0000000000
```

- The color 5 objects in the grid will be moved down and transformed into color 1.
- The color 0 cells will remain empty.
- The color 5 objects in the last two rows will be transformed into color 2.

Following these steps, we can generate the output grid.

To analyze the transformation applied in the training examples, we can identify the following steps:

1. **Example 1**: The color 9 objects are moved down to fill the empty spaces (0s) above them, while the color 0s are replaced by color 9s in the first two rows. The last row remains unchanged as it is already filled with color 9s.

2. **Example 2**: The color 6 objects are moved down, and the empty spaces (0s) are filled with color 6s. The color 0s in the first row are replaced by color 6s, and the color 6s in the second row are shifted down.

3. **Example 3**: The color 9 objects are moved down to fill the empty spaces (0s) above them, while the color 0s are replaced by color 9s in the last two rows.

4. **Example 4**: The color 2 objects are moved down, and the empty spaces (0s) are filled with color 2s. The color 0s in the first row are replaced by color 2s, and the color 2s in the second row are shifted down.

From these examples, we can conclude that the transformation involves moving all color objects down while preserving their order and filling the empty spaces above them with the same color.

Now, applying this transformation to the Test Input:

Test Input:
```
000
500
055
```

1. The color 5 objects in the second and third rows will be moved down to fill the empty spaces above them.
2. The first row is entirely empty (0s), so it will remain unchanged.
3. The color 5 in the second row will move down to the first row, and the color 5 in the third row will move down to the second row.

After applying the transformation, the output grid will be:

1. In the provided examples, the transformation involves moving color objects downwards while preserving their order and making adjustments to their colors.
2. In Example 1, the color 5 objects are moved down to fill the empty spaces below them, and the color 0 cells are replaced with color 5 where necessary.
3. In Example 2, the color 5 objects are also moved down, and the color 2 objects remain in their positions while the color 0 cells are filled appropriately.
4. In Example 3, the same pattern is observed where color 5 objects are moved down, and the color 2 objects are preserved in their positions.
5. The overall transformation can be summarized as moving all color objects (in this case, color 5) downwards to fill the empty spaces while maintaining the order of the objects.

Now, applying this transformation to the Test Input:
1. Identify the positions of color 5 objects in the Test Input grid.
2. Move each color 5 object down to the lowest available position in their respective columns.
3. Ensure that the order of the color 5 objects is preserved.

The Test Input grid is:
```
000000000000000

000000000000000
000000000000000
000000000000000
```

The color 5 objects are located at:
- Row 6, Column 6
- Row 6, Column 7
- Row 6, Column 8
- Row 7, Column 5
- Row 9, Column 6
- Row 9, Column 7

We will engage in tasks that require reasoning and logic.
You will be presented with grids made up of numbers.
Number 0 represents empty cells and the other numbers represent objects or patterns on the grid.
First you will be shown some example tasks together with the identified transformation(s).
Then you will be presented with a novel task. Follow these steps:
1. Carefully analyze each input-output example in the task and identify the transformation.
2. Describe the transformation step by step.
3. Apply the identified transformation to the Test input grid to generate the output grid.
4. Use the marker '---Analysis Start---' before providing your analysis of the transformation.
5. Use the marker '---Output Grid Start---' before providing the final output grid.
6. Use the same format as the one provided in the examples for your output grid.
7. Use the marker '---Output Grid End---' at the end of the final output grid.

To identify the transformation applied in the training examples, let's analyze them step by step:

**Example 1:**
Input:
```
454
555
454
```
Output:
```
040
444
040
```
Transformation:
1. The color 5 objects are replaced with color 4 objects in the middle row.
2. The color 4 objects in the first and last rows are replaced with color 0 objects, effectively removing them.

**Example 2:**
Input:
```
55666
65566
66556
66655
56665
```
Output:
```
66000
06600
00660
00066
60006
```
Transformation:
1. The color 5 objects are replaced with color 6 objects in a downward movement, while the color 6 objects are shifted to the left and down, creating a new pattern.

**Example 3:**
Input:
```
95999
99559
95999
99599
99955
```
Output:
```
09000
00990
09000
00900
00099
```
Transformation:
1. The color 9 objects are replaced with color 0 objects in the first column, while the color 5 objects are shifted downwards and recolored to 9.

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation involves moving and recoloring objects in a specific manner, often involving a downward shift and replacement of colors.

Now, let's apply this reasoning to the Test Input.

Test Input:
```
33353
35333
35535
33353
55533
```

1. Identify the color objects: The grid contains color 3 and color 5.
2. The color 5 objects will be moved downwards and recolored to color 3.
3. The color 3 objects will be shifted downwards, and any color 3 objects that are in the last row will be replaced with color 0.

Following these steps, we will generate the output grid.
